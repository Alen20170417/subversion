/*
 * See the notes/treeconflicts/ directory for more information.
 *
 * Currently, we only concern ourselves with the signaling of tree
 * conflicts as described in notes/treeconflicts/use-cases.txt.
 *
 * There is no automatic resolution, the "desired behaviour" in
 * the use case descriptions is far from being implemented here.
 *
 * All we are trying to achieve is making sure that users are made aware
 * of having run into a potentially dangerous tree conflict situation.
 *
 * We do this by trying to recognize known tree conflict use cases
 * and persisting information about them in the "tree-conflicts" field
 * in the this_dir entry in the entries file for the directory containing
 * the tree conflict.
 *
 * A given directory may contain potentially many tree conflicts.
 * Each tree conflict is identified by the filename of the file
 * or directory (both a.k.a node) that it affects.
 * We call this node the "victim" of the tree conflict.
 *
 * For example, a file that is deleted by an update but locally
 * modified by the user is a victim of a tree conflict.
 *
 * For now, tree conflict victims are always direct children of the
 * directory in which the tree conflict is recorded.
 * (This may change once the way Subversion handles adm areas changes.)
 *
 * If a directory has tree conflicts, the "tree-conflict-data" field
 * in the entry for the directory contains one or more tree conflict
 * descriptions.
 *
 * Each description contains several fields, separated by
 * the following character:
 */

#define SVN_WC__TREE_CONFLICT_DESC_FIELD_SEPARATOR ':'

/*
 * The fields are:
 *
 *  victim_path:node_kind:operation:action:reason
 *
 * None of these fields can be empty.
 *
 * The path and victim_path fields correspond to the same fields in
 * svn_wc_conflict_description_t. If there is a colon in the
 * victim_path, it should be escaped with a backslash.
 * A literal backslash in victim_path must also be escaped with a backslash.
 * None of these fields is null-terminated!
 *
 * The escaping conventions mentioned in subversion/libsvn_wc/README also
 * apply, but are transparent to the tree conflicts code.
 *
 * The node_kind of the victim (corresponding to the node_kind field in
 * svn_wc_conflict_description_t) will be useful for tree conflict use cases
 * that involve both directories and files. It can be either "file" or "dir".
 * It cannot be "none".
 *
 * The operation field represents the svn operation that exposed the current
 * tree conflict, and corresponds to the operation field in
 * svn_wc_conflict_description_t.
 *
 * The action and reason fields correspond to the same fields in
 * svn_wc_conflict_description_t.
 *
 * The enum fields have the following mappings to character strings:
 *
 *  node_kind:

 * escape them with the following character:
 */

#define SVN_WC__TREE_CONFLICT_ESCAPE_CHAR '\\'

/*
 * The escape character can itself be escaped.
 *
 * From the information in the tree conflict entry, we can generate
 * a human readable description of tree conflicts in a user-visible
 * file inside the conflicted directory in the working copy.
 *
 * The user is presented with an error upon trying to commit without
 * having resolved the tree conflict by running 'svn resolved' on the
 * tree-conflict's victim.
 *
 * We try not to assume renames in any way. Use case 5 described
 * in the paper attached to issue #2282 requires true renames to be
 * detected,  which is impossible given how Subversion currently handles
 * 'svn move' internally. (Note: cmpilato said the "location segments"
 * feature could be used to detect use case 5.)
