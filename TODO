The following tasks need to be completed before we can merge the
ctypes-python-bindings to trunk.

ctypes-python-bindings TODOs:

 * Allow users to override default paths for both headers and libraries,
   both at compile time and at runtime. Right now, it is possible to
   specify additional paths but it is not possible to override the default
   paths.

 * If users have ctypesgen installed we should use the installed version
   instead of requiring ctypesgen to be in the build dir.

 * We need a setup.py script / installer for installing the ctypes python
   bindings.

 * Teach dist.sh (in Subversion trunk) to download release tarball for
   ctypesgen.

 * Teach autogen.sh --release to generate the python wrappers for ctypes
   python bindings.

 * Create ctypes-python-bindings target in Subversion trunk Makefile for
   generating python wrappers for generating the python wrappers for the
   ctypes python bindings. This target would be a no-op if we are in
   release mode.

 * Create install-ctypes-python-bindings target in Subversion trunk
   Makefile for installing the ctypes python bindings.

ctypesgen TODOs:

 * Build release tarball of ctypesgen to be used for Subversion 1.6.
