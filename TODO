This branch is for handling replacing files with history within a wc.
This covers issue #2148.  But also eventually will cover supporting
allowing the cp and mv commands to replace files.  Currently you can
only get a wc in this state with the merge command.

As of right now files can be replaced.

Specific list of items to do:

* Implement handling of properties.
* Implement handling of properties on directories.
* Write tests.
* Implement the enhancements to the cp and mv command (pretty much done
  just not committed yet).
* Possibly enhance the handling of checksums.  Right now the code isn't
  storing checksums for replaced files.  To fix this would require a new
  field in entries.
