This is the wc-propcaching branch, a feature branch intended to improve
libsvn_wc performance for some operations.  Below are the items to be done
during the lifetime of this branch.
See <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2005-07/1380.shtml> for more information.

* Get rid of props-time field in entries file. (lundblad)

* Make sure there is no props file if no props are modified and no prop-base
  if there are no props at all. (lundblad)

* Make sure prop-mods flag work on copy (write test for it) after the
  install_file patch has been committed and merged from trunk. (lundblad)

* Cache presence of svn:special, and svn:needs-lock and svn:externals
  in entries file. (dberlin)

* Shortcut svn_wc_prop_get for the cached props. (dberlin)

* Consider caching presence of other props.

* Implement WC format upgrading for the new format.
  (Reconsider if we need another WC format bump.)

* Consider keeping track of baseprops existence in entries file.

* Consider storing baseprops (and maybe working props) in a single file
  per directory.
