This is the wc-propcaching branch, a feature branch intended to improve
libsvn_wc performance for some operations.  Below are the items to be done
during the lifetime of this branch.
See <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2005-07/1380.shtml> for more information.

* Get rid of props-time filed in entries file; resolve failing test
  stat_tests.py 13: timestamp behaviour.

* Make sure there is no props file if no props are modified and no prop-base
  if there are no props at all.

* Cache presence of svn:special and svn:needs-lock in entries file.

* Shortcut svn_wc_prop_get for the cached props.

* Consider caching presence of other props.

* Implement WC format upgrading for the new format.
  (Reconsider if we need another WC format bump.)

* Consider keeping track of baseprops existence in entries file.

* Consier storing baseprops (and maybe working props) in a single file
  per directory.
