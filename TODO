This branch exists with the purpose to refactor ra_dav
in order to achieve several goals:

 - Use more pool bound resources (ie fewer Neon ones) as
   those don't need manual tracking.
 - Use as much as possible SVN_ERR macro invocations, to
   line up with the rest of the code base.

As well as this list of specific tasks:

 - Clean up the use of Neon requests as much as possible
   (without duplicating all of Neon's interfaces).
