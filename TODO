This branch exists with the purpose to refactor ra_dav
in order to achieve several goals:

 - Use more pool bound resources (ie fewer Neon ones) as
   those don't need manual tracking.
 - Move away from functions defined in ne_basic.h, because
   they don't let us attach a 'custom error' reader to
   requests without a lot of baton-juggling.
 - Use as much as possible SVN_ERR macro invocations, to
   line up with the rest of the code base.
