This branch is for handling replacing files with history within a wc.
This covers issues #2148, #2135 and #1516.

Resolution of this issue paves the way for resolving issue #2144.

Specific list of items to do:

* Implement handling of properties [done].
* Implement handling of properties on directories. [done]
* Write tests
  - revert of locally replaced file [ done ]
  - revert of locally replaced file with props [ done ]
  - update with changes to a replaced file (with props)
  - update with changes to a replaced file (with prop-changes)
* Change tests from XFAIL to PASS: [ done ]
  - revert_tests 4 (revert_replace_with_history_with_props)
    to do this, a revert-file needs to be implemented for prop-base [done]

* Implement the enhancements to the cp and mv command [ done ]
* Possibly enhance the handling of checksums.  Right now the code isn't
  storing checksums for replaced files.  To fix this would require a new
  field in entries which is no problem, since we need to upgrade the wc
  format anyway. [ not done; should be part of a larger issue with checksums ]

These sources are possible sources for replacements (with history) in a wc:

- wc->wc copy or move operations
- repos->wc copy operations
- merge operations which contain 'R' (replacement) updates
- merge operations which contain 'D+A' (delete + add) updates

Thoughts
========

 * Running 'update' on a target means getting changes from the repository
   into the working copy.  If a file is replaced and the repository sends
   changes to the original file, that is a tree conflict.
   Currently we merge the changes into the replaced file and signal
   conflicts if there are any (content-conflicts).

 * Running a 'merge' on a directory which includes a replaced-with-history
   file, though, would not need to result in conflicts. Does ancestry play
   a role here? If so, which? [ currently handled as a normal update;
