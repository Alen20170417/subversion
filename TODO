This is the wc-propcaching branch, a feature branch intended to improve
libsvn_wc performance for some operations.  Below are the items to be done
during the lifetime of this branch.
See <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2005-07/1380.shtml> for more information.

* Consider caching presence of other props.

* Require MD5 checksums on entries and include this in the WC format
  bump. (dionisos)
  NOTE: Done on this branch to avoid another wc format bump on trunk.

* Use an empty has-props attribute to indicate existence of properties at all.
  Would mean for an enough recent WC: has_props == NULL -> no props,
  has_props == "" -> properties exists but none that are cached
  has_props is some other string -> there are props and some cached.
  svn_wc_status needs to know this, so we can avoid stating each props
  file.

* Consider storing baseprops (and maybe working props) in a single file
  per directory.
