The following tasks need to be completed before we can merge the
ctypes-python-bindings to trunk.

ctypes-python-bindings TODOs:

 * We need a setup.py script / installer for installing the ctypes python
   bindings.

 * Teach dist.sh (in Subversion trunk) to download release tarball for
   ctypesgen.

 * Teach autogen.sh --release to generate the python wrappers for ctypes
   python bindings.

 * Create ctypes-python-bindings target in Subversion trunk Makefile for
   generating python wrappers for the ctypes python bindings. This target
   would be a no-op if we are in release mode.

 * Create install-ctypes-python-bindings target in Subversion trunk
   Makefile for installing the ctypes python bindings.

ctypesgen TODOs:

 * Build release tarball of ctypesgen to be used for Subversion 1.6.
