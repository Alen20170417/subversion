This is the wc-propcaching branch, a feature branch intended to improve
libsvn_wc performance for some operations.  Below are the items to be done
during the lifetime of this branch.
See <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2005-07/1380.shtml> for more information.

* Cache existence of properties in .svn/entries. (lundblad)

* Consider caching presence of other props.

* Require MD5 checksums on entries and include this in the WC format
  bump. (dionisos)
  NOTE: Done on this branch to avoid another wc format bump on trunk.

* Consider storing baseprops (and maybe working props) in a single file
  per directory.
