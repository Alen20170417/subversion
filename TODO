This is the wc-propcaching branch, a feature branch intended to improve
libsvn_wc performance for some operations.  Below are the items to be done
during the lifetime of this branch.
See <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2005-07/1380.shtml> for more information.

* Bump WC format.

* Keep track of whether props are modified or not in the entries file.

* Make sure there is no props file if no props are modified.

* Use the above in the modification detection code for props.

* Cache presence of svn:special and svn:needs-lock in entries file.

* Shortcut svn_wc_prop_get for the cached props.

* Consider caching presence of other props.
