Branch purpose
==============

The purpose of this branch is to create a client (meaning libsvn_wc,
libsvn_client) which is NFC/NFD unicode aware for those cases where
it matters. Currently the list of 'where it matters' consists of:

 * Path names
 * Changelist names

A related subject which might become part of this branch is
URL normalization: URLs of different byte-sequences may mean the
same thing.  That issue is somewhat related to the NFC/NFD issue,
because URLs may suffer from the NFC/NFD issue too.


Items to do
===========

 * Replace strcmp() with svn_path_strcmp() for all path comparisons
   Note: Currently, trivial comparisons, such as SVN_WC_ENTRY_THIS_DIR,
         '.' and '..' are not replaced.
 * Recode changelist names to NFC both when input from the command line
   as well as when read from the entries file
 

Items done
==========

 * Create functions to recode UTF-8 strings to the
  "Subversion global"-Normal Form (which - at least for now - is NFC)
 * Create a function to compare UTF-8 strings taking encoding differences
   into account
 * Create a function to compare UTF-8 paths
