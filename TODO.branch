TODOS in this branch:

- Clean up any noise in the diff against trunk that is still left
  around from all the refactoring (if any).

- glasser says:

  >  * subversion/include/svn_config.h
  >   (svn_config_get_user_config_path): Declare and document.

  prompt need to use it or something)?  You don't use it outside of
  libsvn_subr.
