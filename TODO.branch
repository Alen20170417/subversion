TODO items on this branch:

- properly handle ^C during the prompt

- Add the 'store-plaintext-passwords' option to ~/.subversion/servers,
  in addition to the global one in ~/.subversion/config.
  The use case being that some people may want to save plaintext
  passwords for some servers, but not for others.
  (Is this also possible on a per-repository basis?)
