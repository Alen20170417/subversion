     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.

     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)

 * r1703581
   Allow simple resolving of binary file text conflicts
   Justification:
     Simple usability improvement. Use reported. Regression.

 * r1703688, 1703689
   Fix merging deletes of svn:eol-style CRLF or CR files

     Any more reasons needed? :-)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1704292, r1704573
   Make svn diff --git produce proper forward binary diffs
   Justification:
     Applying accidental reverse diffs might work for git, but isn't
     going to work for our 1.10 'svn patch' implementation.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1704847
   Report both built- and run-time versions of libserf, like we do for
   everything else.
   Justification:
     Easier debugging. Consistency with version-reporting of other runtime
     dependencies.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1703470, r1703475, r1703476, r1703477, r1703544
   Updated INSTALL documentation.
   Justification:
     Corrects outdated and partially incorrect statements
   Votes:
     +1: luke1410

 * r1706783
   Really pass patch result to svn_client_patch() filter 
   Justification:
     Without this fix the filter can't determine the result of a patch.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1706983, r1706999
   Add some @since information to config defines
   Justification:
     Trivial correctness fix. Will propagate to documentation.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1705843, r1710558
   Cleanup external registrations when they are user deleted
   Justification:
     When a directory external is gone remove its registration. Avoids
     working copies with broken state.
   Votes:

     +1: philip (without r1710558)

 * r1708699
   Fix authz with mandatory authn provided by mod_auth_kerb/mod_auth_ntlm.
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.9.2.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1709553
   Fix display of process ID in mod_dav_svn cache statistics.
   Justification:
     User cannot determine to which process the output applies.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1710167
   Set journal-mode in exclusive-locking mode to improve NFS performance.
   Justification:
     Reduces performance regression compared to 1.8.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1710215, r1710290
   Make JavaHL SVNClient.vacuum allow non-absolute, and non-canonical, paths.
   Justification:
     Passing the wrong sort of path triggers an assert and kills the JVM.

     +1: philip

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1706323, r1706324
   Fix a crash in libsvn_ra_serf's multistatus parser caused by dereferencing
   a null pointer.
   Justification:
     Segfault. User reported.
   Notes:
     Can be reproduced by trying to do a -g reverse blame against 1.8 server:
     svn blame -g -r 1706092:1706091 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/README
     .
     r1706323 lays groundwork for the fix by removing unneeded code.
     r1706324 fixes the crash.
   Votes:
     +1: kotkov, philip, ivan

 * r1701598, r1701603, r1701611, r1701646
   Make 'svn lock' and 'svn unlock' report (un)lock errors as failure
   Justification:
     A single lock or unlock failure doesn't affect the whole operation
     since 1.9, but this has the side effect of no longer producing an
     error at all on failures. This patch makes 'svn' return an error when
     at least one failure is reported by the locking code.
   Notes:
     r1701598 is the actual fix. The other patches simplify and fix
     test expectations.
