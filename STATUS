====================================================

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.

     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

 * r1678950, r1678963, r1679864, r1679866
   Ensure full key matching in membuffer cache.
   Justification:
     While the chances of producing an actual key conflict are very slim
     today, they are non-zero.  Due to the central role of the caching
     code, we should not leave that ever so small risk in production for
     the years to come.

 * r1680242, r1680264
   Stop removing last-change-* on non-updates of file externals (issue 4580)
   Justification:
     Resolves regression with 1.7.x/1.8.x pre 1.8.13, caused by issue 4411
     patch. This patch implements this fix in a better way and also fixes
     an incorrectly recorded url in text conflicts caused by updating a
     file external.
