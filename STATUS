This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520
   Silence compiler warnings.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     -0: philip (see dev thread: it's a false alarm, wrong value)
     -0.5: brane (silencing warnings is not a valid reason for a backport,
                  even for branch stabilization.)

 * r1470246
   Improve the interactive resolution of property conflicts.  Instead of
   showing the contents of the '.prej' file once for each prop conflict, show
   initially a single line such as
     "local delete, incoming edit upon merge"
   (similar to resolving a text conflict) and allow the user to display a 3-way
   diff by adding a 'dc - display conflict' option.
   Justification:
     Showing the whole .prej file each time was confusing and ugly when more
     than one property was in conflict.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1471443, r1471490
   Fix a bug in the Summary of Conflicts when using interactive conflict
     resolution.  Marking a text conflict as resolved but leaving a prop
     conflict unresolved on the same file, or vice versa, would decrement
     both the text and prop conflict summary stats.
   Justification:
     Regression since 1.7.
   Notes:
     r1471443 is just a removal of unused code, and is included here in
     order to avoid conflicts.  r1471490 is the main change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, brane

 * r1475772, r1476092
   Fix a bug in authz file processing where group and user names were
   not treated case-sensitively, which could lead to unpredictable
   results depending on the ordering of the authz config entries.
   See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4361
   Justification:
     See above about unpredictable results. A related fix for
     repository paths handling was made in 1.7.0.
   Notes:
     r1476092 is the CHANGES update.
   Votes:
     +1: brane
     +1: philip (for 1.8.0 only, not later 1.8.x)

 * r1477876
   Fix a bug whereby a property conflict description always reported
     'unknown' for the node kind.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad
