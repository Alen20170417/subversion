for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can

===========================

Candidate changes that cannot go into a later 1.9.x:
====================================================

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan
     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

 * r1691928
   Fix issue #4584, "Non-canonical $HOME crashes GPG-agent support code".
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.8.11. Simple cause; simple fix.
   Notes:
     Also nominated for 1.8.x.
     Trunk has a better fix, but less suitable for backporting, in r1691952.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad
     +1: danielsh (either with or without r1691952; haven't tried to reproduce,
                   only reviewed the diff)
     +0: rhuijben (Can't test this part. +1 on the combination with r1691952.
                   I don't see returning a properly canonicalized path
                   instead of a potentially non canonical path as a breaking
                   change that can't be backported. I would call it a bugfix
                   that should be backported)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1692448
   Require Python â‰¥2.7 for Subversion 1.9, part 1: documentation and dependency
   version checks.
   Justification:
     Python 2.6 is EOL; makes adding Python 3 support easier.
   Notes:
     The follow-up, r1692449, is not nominated.
     If this nomination is not accepted, r1692446 (release notes patch) should
     be reverted.
   Depends: the r1691712 group
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, brane
     +0.5: rhuijben (Concept; patch review; untested) [before "Depends:"]

 * r1692469, r1692470
   Fix digest argument typemap in swig-ruby binding to avoid segfault
   Justification:
     Somehow we triggered a typeconversion that didn't set an actual
     value. r1692469 makes it easier to test this with the most recent
     VS compiler.

     +1: rhuijben, brane
