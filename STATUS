delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10788, r10796, r10904, r10914
    Fix performance regression in character encoding translations.  Most
    noticable on Win32, but impacts other platforms as well.
    Justification:
      Slow "svn status" annoys people, especially TSVN users.
    Notes:
      Proposed during 1.1.0 preparation, but it is too late and complicated
      to put in 1.1.0 at this stage.
      This conflicts with the branch.  A patch against r11308 is here:

  * r11064
      Don't show 'Internal Server Error' when accessing the root of
      SVNParentPath with mod_authz_svn.
    Justification:
      This looks ugly to the users and the fix is simple.

  * r11190
    Make it possible to set SVNPathAuthz to Off.
    Justification:
      There is a performance regression from 1.0 when it's set to On
      (which is why it was implemented in the first place).

  * r11262, r11274
    Fix issue #2012.  Allow URI-encoded drive letter and separator (: or |).
    Justification:
      Regression fix.

  * r11215, r11264
      SVN has needed a good packaging script for Win32 since forever.
    Justification:
      This and the related build and test script changes will make
      creating 1.1.x Win32 binary packages a lot easier.

  * r11290
      Fix an error in the perl bindings.
    Justification:
      Completely breaks Perl bindings for some versions of Perl.

  * r11296
    Fix 'svn export -rBASE' when the working copy has added files or
    directories that have been committed yet.
    Justification:
      It's an irritating bug with a simple fix.
