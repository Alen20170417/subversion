This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17401
    Only regenerate SWIG files based on timestamps when we are in
    non-release mode.
    Justification:
      Prior to r17401, Subversion regenerated the SWIG files if 'make'
      determined that the SWIG files were out of date, based on their
      timestamps. This caused the SWIG files to be incorrectly
      regenerated if the exact timestamps from the tarball were not
      preserved. Thanks to r17401, we now only regenerate SWIG files
      based on timestamps when we are in non-release mode.

Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17365, r17377, r17379, r17403, r17405
    Clean autogenerated SWIG files when the user types "make clean" and
    we are not in release mode.
    Justification:
      - Without this fix, a user would have to type
          make extraclean-swig-py extraclean-swig-rb extraclean-swig-pl
        to clean the autogenerated SWIG files.
    Notes:
      - r17403 causes a trivial conflict. I'll create a merge branch
        to solve this.
    Dependencies: r17401
