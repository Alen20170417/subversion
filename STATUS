Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1705038
   Fix issue 4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1794166, r1795087
   Search for gpg-agent sockets in (/var)/run.
   Justification:
     Improves GPG socket detection when $GPG_AGENT_INFO is unset or when gpg
     >= 2.1.13 is used
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1794166
   Votes:
     +1: jamessan
     -0: stsp (see https://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2017-05/0047.shtml) (without r1795087)

 * r1795116, r1796167 
   Fix 'svn up' after a directories replaced a file (issue #4677).
   Justification:
     User-reported error that is difficult to work around because more
     "finding the last relevant copy" is broken.  That affects more than
     just 'svn up'.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1795116
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, jamessan
     +0: stsp (text conflict in subversion/tests/libsvn_fs/fs-test.c) (without r1796167)

 * r1802032, r1803825
   Install 'fsfs-stats' as a wrapper to 'svnfsfs', to which it was renamed in
   r1618848.
   Justification:
     Backwards compatibility with 1.8.x tools/.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, jamessan

 * r1804013
   'svnadmin upgrade' of BDB: Error out on too-new formats.
   Justification:
     Prevents random corruptions when the arguments are invalid in a
     particular way.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1808955, r1808956, r1809558, r1809564
   Transmit the run-time HTTPD version to the DAV test driver.
   Justification:
     Prevents spurious test failures where compile-time and run-time
     HTTPD versions are different.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1808955
   Votes:
     +1: brane

   Upgrade to utf8proc 2.1.0.
   Justification:
     Fixes some bugs, supports Unicode 9.0, improves preformance,
     walks the dog, does the dishes and repays your mortage.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'

   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.

     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at

   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)
     -1: brane (Not a valid backport, contrib/ is not in the release tarball.)
