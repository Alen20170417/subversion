Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)

 * r1705038
   Fix issue 4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1722164
   Filter out -Wdate-time from SWIG_CPPFLAGS
   Justification:
     Fixes bindings build failure when -Wdate-time is present in $CPPFLAGS
   Votes:
     +1: jamessan
     +1: rhuijben (Would prefer some redesign for trunk though)

 * r1721488, r1721648
   Enable building bindings with SWIG >= 3.0.6
   Justification:
     Enable building bindings with SWIG 3.x.  SWIG 2.x is end-of-life (no
     releases since 2014) and is starting to be removed from Linux
     distributions.
   Branch:

 * r1721285
   Quadruple the maximum cacheable directory size in FSFS.
   Justification:
     Not caching large directories has a massive impact on runtime with
     the cutoff point being about 9000 entries for the default cache size.
     Also, memory usage with mod_dav_svn may go through the roof for
     uncached directories.

     -0: stsp (merge conflict; needs a backport branch)

 * r1724448
   Fix handling of newly secured subdirectories in a working copy
   Justification:
     Regression against <= 1.6.x. Without this patch a directory that
     (still) exists locally but to which a user has no access is handled as
     a local obstruction on the next update that brings a change to this tree
     and the local working copy state is broken. This patch handles the
     incomming change as a delete, properly marking a tree conflict if
     necessary, allowing a user to make a copy of local changes.
     (Committing a copy would be hard though... as the user most likely
      doesn't have the rights to copy from what is now hidden).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1735179
   build system: Improve svn_error_symbolic_name()'s data gatherer.
   Justification:
     The incumbent warning message is unclear and might have false positives.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, stsp

 * r1717874, r1717875, r1717878, r1716808
   Make inherited property api consistent over all ra layers
   Justification:
     Our ra implementations should follow the documentation... and should
     be as consistent as possible between each other. Only because the
     caller uses svn_path_url_add_component2() this wasn't noticed by
     our code.
   Notes:
     r1716808 needed for SVN_TEST_INT_ASSERT macro. I think it makes
     sense to backport this change to simplify future backports.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, steveking (without r1716808)
     +1: ivan

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1717876, r1717877
   Fix svn_fs_contents_different on FSFS producing false negatives.
   Justification:
     Under rare circumstances, see issue #4554, the API may not recognize
     two file contents as being different.  This may result in incomplete
     reports and dump files.
   Notes:
     r1717877 provides a test case that verifies everything still works
     even with the EXPANDED_SIZE check removed.

     +1: stefan2, rhuijben, stsp

 * r1725180
   Reduce peak memory usage when listing large directories in FSFS.
   Justification:
     Allocating large blocks through APR has unpleasant side-effects
     for the allocation pattern used in mod_dav's request processing.
     Also, there is simply no point in serializing data that wouldn't
     make it into the cache after all.

 * r1663500, r1737122, r1739278, r1739280
   Fix issue #4557, "ra_serf fails to delete directory containing many files"
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.8.10.
