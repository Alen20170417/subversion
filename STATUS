===========================

Candidate changes that cannot go into a later 1.9.x:
====================================================

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan
     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

 * r1683303
   Resolve a race condition in some test suite cleanup code.
   Justification:
     Without this patch running the testsuite on bdb x svnserve consistently
     fails on at least some Windows test systems. bdb x serf sometimes
     triggers the same problem, but in far less cases.
     .
     This specific test -unlike other tests- cleans up its own environment a
     few times to retry some scenarios on the same paths.

 * r1683378
   Prevent a possible FSFS repository corruption with power or network disk
   failures during 'svnadmin pack'.
   Justification:
     Repository corruption/data loss.
   Note:
     This is not regression since 1.8.x and change can be released in patch
     release.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan

 * r1684325, r1684344
   Fix an unintended doubling of error messages in 'svnadmin verify'
   without the --keep-going flag.
   Justification:
     Fixes a bug that was introduced in r1683311, which was
     already merged to 1.9.x.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1684077
   Detect invalid svndiff data earlier.
   Justification:
     Do not waste memory on invalid user or server input.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan, brane, rhuijben

 * r1684412
   Make JavaHL native code compile with a C++11 compiler.
   Justification:
     The upcoming MSVC14, part of Visual Studio 2015,
     supports user-defined literals, which means that
     trying to build JavaHL with VS2015 will fail.
   Note:
     To test this change with gcc/clang on *ix, edit the file
     build/ac-macros/compiler.m4 to replace '-std=c++98' with
     '-std=c++11', then autogen, configure, build and run
     the JavaHL tests.
