Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10299, r10339:
    When configured without Berkeley DB, make libsvn_fs default to
    the fsfs back-end.
    Votes:
      +1 (r10299 only): epg, rooneg
      +1: ghudson

  * r10313:
    Shouldn't tell people that --without-berkeley-db will keep us
    from building the server parts of Subversion when it really doesn't.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, epg, ghudson

  * r10317
    URIs never should end in a / when returned from svn_path_canonicalize().
    Justification: http://svn/ would result in an assertion failure. Very ugly.
    Votes:
      +1: breser, jpieper, ghudson

  * r10324
    Fix a simple bug when avoiding setting time stamps on special
    files.  This can cause svn to abort when checking out/updating a
    symlink pointing to a non-existant path.
