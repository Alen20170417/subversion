This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10604
    Cleanup some qsort-related stuff.
    Justification:
      Removes *4* redundant functions, but adds a new API.
    Notes:
      The docstring for svn_sort_compare_paths says "New in 1.1."
      and needs to be updated to say 1.2 if this does not go in.
    Votes:
      -0: ghudson, lundblad (what's the point of putting code cleanups into
          1.1?)
      +1: cmpilato

  * r10800 (Issue #2031)
    Add -lstdc++ to javahl binding DSO at link-time.
    Justification:
      The javahl shared library does not link correctly on certain platforms.
      (This is really a libtool bug.)
      (Well, more that we use libtool 1.4, which has no C++ support.)

  * r10819, r10855
    Avoid repository corruption if executed with closed std{in,out,err}
    Justification:
      Simple fix for a nasty problem that has bitten at least one user.

       -1: brane [until someone explains to me why this should be a
                  Unix-only change]

Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10788, r10796, r10904
    Fix performance regression in character encoding translations.  Most
    noticable on Win32, but impacts other platforms as well.
    Justification:
      Slow "svn status" annoys people, especially TSVN users.
    Notes:
      Proposed during 1.1.0 preparation, but it is too late and complicated
      to put in 1.1.0 at this stage.
