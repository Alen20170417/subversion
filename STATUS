This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1660593
   Fix recording last-* information on nodes copied from foreign repositories
   Justification:
     Recording revisions (and other details) of foreign repositories causes
     incorrect status output and bugs when using -rCOMMITTED, -rPREV, etc.
     Local fix.

     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1660646
   Fix calculating the repository path of replaced directories on entry upgrade
   Justification:
     Simple fix that avoids recording invalid data in WC-NG.

     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1661131, r1661179
   Reduce revision gaps on simple moves during commit.
   Justification:
     Simple fix that exposes some of our hard work on move support in 1.8-1.9.
   Notes:
     This implements only the very simplest case to avoid touching too much
     code, but it should handle the most common move cases.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1661247
   Support Python 3 in autogen.sh / gen-make.py.
   Justification:
     Allow building with Python 3, since Python 2 is end-of-life:

 * r1661195,r1661208,r1661235,r1661236,r1661238,r1661253
   More 'svn blame' fixes.
   Justification:
     Cleans up the 'Prospective blame' implementation to something usable.
   Depends:
     Requires that the already approved r1660969 group is merged.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1661451, r1661484, r1661511
   Expose metadata_only option on svn_client_copy7()
   Justification:
     We revved this api in 1.9, and already expose this flag for move
     and revert. The implementation is used by at least one Subversion
     GUI since 1.8 (as the flag is available at the libsvn_wc level)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip (not after 1.9.0)

 * r1661476, r1661480, r1661482
   Fix a segfault when running 'svn info' on a WORKING exclude
   Justification:
     Optimizes url calculation through libsvn_wc and libsvn_client and
     fixes a few real bugs. Makes not-present behavior in info explicit.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-db-verify
   Make the db and entries-compat test create valid databases. This merge
   fixes a lot of plumbing to bring in further db consistency fixes.
   Notes:
     While not a good backport suggestion by itself, other backports
     will depend on this backport. As subset this is not to hard to
     review (see logmessage on branch).
     .
     Merges: r1660587,1660610,1660633,1660641,1660659,1660671,1660687,
              1660758,1660874,1660928,1660955,1660961
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1661934
   Make 'svn cp WC URL' provide sane items in its template
   Justification:
     Makes creating backport logmessages much easier. Simple fix.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-commit-fixes
   Make the commit logic properly remove locks and break moves.
   Justification:
     Without this patch an incomplete commit will make the database
     inconsistent (leave half moves). Some commits may also leave lock
     tokens that are no longer valid.
     .
     These move cases should not be possible when committing from
     libsvn_client, (as these try to avoid these situations), but at least
     the old libsvn_wc public apis allow corrupting the db, as these give
     access to the wc side commit logic.
   Notes:
     Depends on, and is based of the ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-db-verify
     branch. Merges: r1660781,1661335,1661363,1661504,1661730,1661755
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-update-tc-detection
   Improve tree conflict detection in the update editor.
   Justification:
     Without this patch the update editor in many cases doesn't see local
     unversioned items, and continues as if they aren't there. This includes
     items that were deleted and then replaced (but not added yet). These
     limitations affect how we record and handle these situations.
   Notes:
     This changes a public api (svn_wc_status3_t), so can't be released
     in this form after 1.9.0
     .
     Depends on, and is based of the ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-db-verify
     branch. Merges: r1661570,1661654,1661664,1661669,1661673,1661695,1661698
     .
     Recommended way to review: check branch.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1661718 and many others
   Fix invalid database state (moves) on incoming deletes during update
   Justification:
     Fixes database corruption. A huge catch-up merge is probably easier
     than a backport.

     +0: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================


Approved changes:
=================

 * r1660969, r1660975, r1660991, r1661120, r1661121
   Fix assertion reported as part of issue #4467,
   Justification:
     Fixing a few simple revision checks inside the blame handling allows the
     'kidney blame' to work without assertions failing.
   Notes:
     r1661120 adds a regression test for this assertion problem, in which
     it is required that the file doesn't change in the passed revision.
