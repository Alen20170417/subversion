   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at

     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)

 * r1703688, 1703689
   Fix merging deletes of svn:eol-style CRLF or CR files
   Justification:
     Resolves unnecessary tree conflicts.
     Any more reasons needed? :-)

 * r1704292, r1704573
   Make svn diff --git produce proper forward binary diffs
   Justification:
     Applying accidental reverse diffs might work for git, but isn't
     going to work for our 1.10 'svn patch' implementation.

     Corrects outdated and partially incorrect statements

 * r1710167
   Set journal-mode in exclusive-locking mode to improve NFS performance.

 * r1706428, r1706437, r1709388, r1711250, r1711507, r1711510
   Fix issue #4598, "No-op changes no longer dumped by 'svnadmin dump' in 1.9"
   Justification:
     Possible loss of information, different dumps produced by svnadmin and
     svnrdump.  Repository dumps can be used for backup purposes.  Regression
     from 1.8.
   Notes:
     Whole discussion is in http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-09/0269.shtml
     (Subject: "No-op changes no longer dumped by 'svnadmin dump' in 1.9").
     .
     r1706428, r1706437 add a regression test.  r1709388, r1711507 fix the
     issue.  r1711250, r1711510 update documentation.  Backport branch is
     required due to conflict in /subversion/tests/cmdline/svnadmin_tests.py
   Branch:

 * r1668625
   Fix 'svn diff --summarize --ignore-properties'.
   Justification:
     --ignore-properties option should not be ignored in summarize diff mode.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1706375
   Following up on r1700215: unbreak the test runner's compabitility mode.
   Justification:
     Impossible to run tests with older repository formats.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan

 * r1712927
   Fix svn_fs_contents_different on FSFS producing false negatives.
   Justification:
     Under rare circumstances, see issue #4554, the API may not recognize
     two file contents as being different.  This may result in incomplete
     reports and dump files.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1715793
   Do not read TXN props on every svn_fs_txn_open() call in libsvn_fs_fs: FSFS
   doesn't use transaction_t.proplist (and never used). This code seems to
   inherited from BDB.
   Justification:
     It's not regression, but it's obvious removal of dead code that is
     responsible for about 5% of I/O operations when running testsuite over
     http:// protocol on Windows, because mod_dav_svn opens TXN for every
     request on transaction.

   mod_dav_svn: Use LimitXMLRequestBody httpd directive to control maximum

     skel-encoded requests.
