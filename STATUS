This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29531, r29533, r29542, r29551, r29607
   Improve memory usage and runtime of 'log -g'.
   Notes: r29531 and r29533 are doc string changes to prevent textual
          conflicts with r29542.

      +1: hwright

  * r29738, 29751
    Allow 'log -g' to work in reverse order, and with --stop-on-copy.
    Notes: While r29738 really isn't required (r29751 removes the line it
      addes), it eliminates textual conflicts when mering r29751.
