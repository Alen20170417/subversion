Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12133 (Issue #2106)
    Client-side memory leak when doing 'svn switch' over http://.
    Justification: Scalability bug, very small & simple fix.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel, epg

  * r11483, r12072, r12157, r12158 (Issue #2091)
    Unitialized variable on Win98.
    Justification:
      It was causing random failures for our Win98 users.  The fix
      also correctly sets the locale path now, making locale stuff
      work as well.
    Notes: Change looks good to me.  I can't in good conscience +1
      it only because I don't have the environment to test nor the
      docs to review the MultiByteToWideChar() call.  -kfogel

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

      Nominated by: David James <james82@gmail.com>

  * r11708
    Fix a bug which caused certain unfinished switch operations to leave
    the working copy in a busticated state.
    Justification:
      Did you miss the part where I said "working copy ... busticated state"?
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, epg

  * r11862, r11921, r12061 (part of issue #1997)
    Fix encoding bug in svnserve -h.
    Justification:
      Encoding bugs look ugly.
    Note:
      r12061 is just a docstring clarification.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, maxb, epg
      +0: nori (not r12061)

  * r11936
    Fixes a 'working copy not locked' error.
    Justification:
      It's a regression from 1.0.x.
    Votes:
      +1: philip, epg
      Nominated by: Chris AtLee <catlee@sidefx.com>

  * r12006
    Fix issue 2124 - bugs in svn switch over ra-dav.
    Justification:
      Changes made in the 1.1 client cause 1.0 and 1.1 servers to be
      driven in a way that weren't able to handle, resulting in
      working copies that *look* okay, but can actually send commits
      to the wrong repository location (if able to commit at all).
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato

  * r12046
    Fix issue 2142 - svndumpfilter mislabels output as version 3.
    Justification:
      Prevents chaining of multiple svndumpfilter runs.
      (This is a regression from 1.0.x)
      Trivial change.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, epg

  * r12063, r12084 (Issue #2119)
    Canonicalize paths received over the wire in ra_svn and svnserve.
    Justification:
      Protects against API violations, which lead to assertion failures.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, epg

  * r12100, r12111, r12114
    Fix output of notifications when merging a deletion of a directory.
    Justification:
      It just looks ugly and sloppy.
    Branch: 1.1.x-r12100
    Votes:
      +1: breser

  * r12102
    Fix a slight ABI/API incompatability between 1.0.x and 1.1.x
    Justification:
      If we treat the Apache modules as just another client then e broke our
      compatability rules.  This fixes it and makes the Debian folks happy
      who have an open bug on the issue.  See:
      http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=275545
    Votes:
      +1: breser

  * r12117
    Fix merges that replace directories.
    Justification:
      Without this fix it is impossible to merge some sets of revisions in one
      step.
    Branch: 1.1.x-r12117
    Votes:
      +1: breser

  * r11438
    Fix a bug that caused 'svnversion --version .' to crash.
    Justification:
      Segfaults bad!
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, epg, rooneg

  * r12172
    Create FSFS write-lock file when repository is created.
    Justification:
      Fixed an edge-case umask dependency for FSFS repositories.
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson, epg, cmpilato


Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r11439, r11669
    Fix slow "svn st" where the targets are files by not locking the whole
    anchor tree.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, dionisos, ghudson
      (r11439 nominated by): Steve King

  * r11665
    Make FSFS commits work with insert-only perms on db/revs.
    Justification:
      This is a pretty straightforward order-of-operations change, is
      how I (Greg) always intended FSFS to work, and fulfills what has
      been a secondary goal of FSFS from the beginning.
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson, epg, maxb

  * Issue #2111
    Fix RPM build breakage.
    Justification:

      +1: david, ghudson

  * r11047 (Issue #2032)
    Always call mkdir-init, even if we're not in a VPATH setup.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL without manually creating
      directories to work around Issue #2032.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, ghudson, maxb
      Nominated by: David James <james82@gmail.com>

    Votes:
      +1: brane, lundblad, maxb

  * r11740
    Fix encoding bug in svn ls -v.

  * r11685
    Internationalization issues for the Windows Installer
