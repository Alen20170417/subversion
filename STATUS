Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r19528
    Plug memleak with svn ls and mod_dav_svn.
    Justification:
      Listing large directories consumes large amounts of memory.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad

  * r19535, r19536
    Plug memleak in switch --relocate.
    Justification:
      Annoying if you relocate large trees.

      r19536 reverts a part that should never have been committed.
