This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the the time
being applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are
not core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

 * r29155
   Allow packagers to build some parts of svn against installed svn libs.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r29194
   Rename an error code.
   Notes:
     Must be reverted on trunk if not backported.
     Depends on r29193 (loosely).

 * r29230-29231, r29233
   Obsessively destroy Neon requests, even in error cases.

   Remove use of an extra RA session.

 * r29320
   Rename the JavaHL MergeInfo class to Mergeinfo, for consistency with our
   mergeinfo-as-noun policy.
   Note: This is an incompatible change, and must be backported or reverted
     on trunk.
