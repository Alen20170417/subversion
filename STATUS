This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1660593
   Fix recording last-* information on nodes copied from foreign repositories
   Justification:
     Recording revisions (and other details) of foreign repositories causes
     incorrect status output and bugs when using -rCOMMITTED, -rPREV, etc.
     Local fix.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1660646
   Fix calculating the repository path of replaced directories on entry upgrade
   Justification:
     Simple fix that avoids recording invalid data in WC-NG.

 * r1661131, r1661179
   Reduce revision gaps on simple moves during commit.
   Justification:
     Simple fix that exposes some of our hard work on move support in 1.8-1.9.
   Notes:
     This implements only the very simplest case to avoid touching too much
     code, but it should handle the most common move cases.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1661247
   Support Python 3 in autogen.sh / gen-make.py.
   Justification:
     Allow building with Python 3, since Python 2 is end-of-life:

 * r1661195,r1661208,r1661235,r1661236,r1661238,r1661253
   More 'svn blame' fixes.
   Justification:
     Cleans up the 'Prospective blame' implementation to something usable.
   Depends:
     Requires that the already approved r1660969 group is merged.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1661451
   Expose metadata_only option on svn_client_copy7()
   Justification:
     We revved this api in 1.9, and already expose this flag for move
     and revert. The implementation is used by at least one Subversion
     GUI since 1.8 (as the flag is available at the libsvn_wc level)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (not after 1.9.0)

 * r1661476
   Fix a segfault when running 'svn info' on a WORKING exclude
   Justification:
     Optimizes url calculation through libsvn_wc and libsvn_client and
     fixes a few real bugs.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================


Approved changes:
=================

 * r1660969, r1660975, r1660991, r1661120, r1661121
   Fix assertion reported as part of issue #4467,
   Justification:
     Fixing a few simple revision checks inside the blame handling allows the
     'kidney blame' to work without assertions failing.
   Notes:
     r1661120 adds a regression test for this assertion problem, in which
     it is required that the file doesn't change in the passed revision.
