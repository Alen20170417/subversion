Status of 1.8.16:

Candidate changes:
==================
 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser
     -0: julianfoad (test is missing from branch -- how do we know it works?)

 * r1654932, r1654933, r1654934, r1654937
   Fix issue #4554, "0 file length reported in FSFS".
   Justification:
     This causes 'svnadmin dump' to create corrupted output that fails to
     load and we provide no way to detect that problem other than loading
     the respective dump.  We also want to prevent further instances of
     that issue to be added to the repository.
   Notes:
     r1561419 has been removed from this change set and proposed for a
     separate backport because it is not a necessary part of the #4554 fix.

   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2
     +0: danielsh (hard to review all potential causes of expanded_size==0 in
                   7*3*2 cases (1.1…1.8) × (file/dir/prop rep) × (plain/delta))

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.

     +0: julianfoad (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)

 * r1702299, r1702300, r1702397, r1702407, r1702565
   Handle merging to local add as error instead of segfault.
   Justification:
     Segfault. User reported.
   Notes:
     r1702299 adds a testcase.
     r1702397 fixes the problem with automatic merge and updates the test.
     r1702565 fixes a quite similar segfault with --reintegrate merge.
     The other revisions are minor cleanup.

 * r1703470, r1703475
   Updated INSTALL documentation.
   Justification:
     Corrects outdated statement.
   Votes:
     +1: luke1410

 * r1706783
   Really pass patch result to svn_client_patch() filter 
   Justification:
     Without this fix the filter can't determine the result of a patch.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * 1708699
   Fix authz with mandatory authn provided by mod_auth_kerb/mod_auth_ntlm.
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.8.14.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1711346
   Properly remove tempfiles in svnlook on diff errors such as EPIPE.
   Justification:
     Simple fix makes it far less likely that tempfiles are left behind
     on the server.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1717875, r1717878
   Make inherited property api consistent over all ra layers
   Justification:
     Our ra implementations should follow the documentation... and should
     be as consistent as possible between each other. Only because the
     caller uses svn_path_url_add_component2() this wasn't noticed by
     our code.
   Notes:
     A test for this issue was added in r1717874, but requires plumbing
     that isn't available on 1.8.x
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1714790
   Fix ruby test suite to work with test-unit gem.
   Justification:
     Ruby test suite would simply not run on Ubuntu 15.10.
     The patch is limited to rb test suite code only.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1539230
   Make JAVAHL tests pass on symlinked ramdiscs.
   Justification:
     We will support 1.8.x for quite some time still.  So, if a low-risk
     patch avoids confusion during release signing etc., I think it is
     worth it.  The patch is limited to JAVAHL test code only.
