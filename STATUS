This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.

     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

 * r1685085
   Install svnbench as part of 'make install'.
   Justification:
     svnbench moved from  tools/ to subversion/ so it should be installed
     by default.

 * r1686554, r1686557, r1686239, r1686541, r1686543, r1686802
   Fix 'svnadmin hotcopy' for read-only FSFS repositories
   Justification:
     Format 7 repositories could not be hotcopied without write access to
     the source repo - which is a regression vs. older formats.  Because
     the new test case also uncovered another regression with hotcopying
     the rep-cache.db from r/o repos.
   Notes:
     The first two revisions contain the actual fix, the others provide a
     test case.  Since the total lines changed is small, the most efficient
     way to review is to via the combined diff.

 * r1686478, r1686888
   Make 'blame -g' work with old clients against new servers.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, old clients will "lose track" of what changes
     happened in -g mode and produce wrong / worse blames than against
     old servers.
     The output of 'blame -g' is only an approximation.  However, the
     new server would cause much worse results in old clients especially
     in simple cases where lines of development are kept in close sync.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, rhuijben

 * r1682714, r1682854, r1683126, r1683135, r1683290
   Fix segfaults in FSX's directory processing code.
   Justification:
     Despite its experimental state, FSX shall not segfault the server.
   Notes:
     The last 3 patches combine to a 1-liner and are included verbatim
     to prevent conflicts.  Since the total lines changed is small, the
     most efficient way to review is to do it via the combined diff.
