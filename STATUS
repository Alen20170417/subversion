Status of 1.9.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1698312
   Correctly report empty representations in 'svnfsfs stats'.
   Justification:
     The current code displays the "0" bracket in histograms as
     "-2147483648 .. < 1" instead of "0 .. < 1".  Technically correct
     but annoying.  UI change only.

 * r1701488
   Fixed check-mime-type.pl so that it also works for svnlook versions from
   1.7.8 (r1416637).
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.

     +0: julianfoad (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)

 * r1701064, r1701206, r1701298
   Fix spurious 'Access Denied' errors during checkout or commit on Windows
   reported on TortoiseSVN users mailing list:
   http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=4061&dsMessageId=3134203
   Justification:
     Regression from Subversion 1.8.x.
   Notes:
     The r1701298 is the fix itself, r1701064 and r1701206 are just formatting
     fixes and cleanups.

 * r1700215, r1700219, r1700220, r1701270
   Fix argument passing in test suite.
   Justification:
     Makes svnfsfs_tests.py work in fsfs-v4 and fsfs-v6 modes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1700215
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Log level on standard invocation of win-tests.py changes)

 * r1701598
   Make 'svn lock' and 'svn unlock' report (un)lock errors as failure
   Justification:
     A single lock or unlock failure doesn't affect the whole operation
     since 1.9, but this has the side effect of no longer producing an
     error at all on failures. This patch makes 'svn' return an error when
     at least one failure is reported by the locking code.
   Votes:
     +0.9: rhuijben (Minor behavior change. Needs more dev@ discussion)
