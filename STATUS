This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.14:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1435635, r1435714, r1435722, r1435737
   When svn update removes a switched subtree because it was deleted in the
   target revision, it would be nice if a future update would bring back
   the originally node that existed before switching. (Issue #4295)
   Justification:
     After this operation the working copy doesn't match the repository
     without obviouse way to recover.
   Notes:
     The real fix is in r1435722. The other revisions tweak the test that
     also triggered a different revision on trunk.

   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: stsp (nice fix, but backport doesn't compile)

 * r1438879
   Make 'show-diff' at the interactive conflict prompt show nicer diffs.
   Justification:
     'show-diff' produces unreadable diffs in some cases, especially with
     conflicts recorded during merges.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1438879
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +0: rhuijben (Shouldn't we provide a three way diff instead of guessing
                   a base to show a one way diff against based on the
                   operation?
                   
                   I would prefer to have show-diff always work against
                   the local pristine version, instead of sometimes against
                   their or their-old (src-left) version, as that is the final
                   change I would commit.)

 * r1461760
   Additional fix related to issue #4340, "filenames containing \n corrupt
   FSFS repositories"
   Justification:
     This change makes libsvn_repos block filenames containing control
     characters. Control characters in filenames have always been rejected
     by libsvn_client, but client-side software bypassing libsvn_client
     could still commit such filenames. Control characters in filenames
     can cause problems not just in FSFS but also in dump files, unidiff,
     and possibly elsewhere. It is a good idea to make the client and
     server consistent.
     See discussion linked from issue #4340 for more information.

     +1: stsp
     -0: danielsh (restrictions not suitable for introduction in patch release;
                   dev@ thread started 2013/05/10 9pm)

 * r1516806
   Do not look at the hostname part of an URI when checking that
   the schema data is canonical.
   Justification:
     As reported on dev@, "svn co file://./" and similar commands abort
     instead of returning an error that the URL is invalid.  This was
     caused by svn_uri_is_canonical treating the hostname "." as a path
     segment.  After this change, svn_uri_is_canonicall correctly
     determines that the URL is (syntactically) canonical, and the
     commands later fail with a normal error in the RA layer, which
     validates the semantics of the hostname.

 * r1527112
   Fix OOM with concurrent requests right after threaded server start.
   Changes:
     This was a common condition in my load tests.  Affects threaded
     servers only.  Apache will just respawn a new worker process.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1527103

     +1: stefan2, brane

 * r1536790
   Limit the time spent in committing files with deep change histories
   Justification:
      The problem has been observed in the real world with certain
      committs taking hours instead of seconds.  This patch sets a
      firm limit to the internal processing effort and cuts it down
      from several hours to a few minutes.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1409804
   Add a delimiter between the two chains in svn_error_compose_create().
   Justification:
     Allow users to tell where the second error chain starts -- avoids
     misrepresentation that the first error is caused by the second.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (I'm not sure if this should be in a patch release and the
                   stacktrace where this refers to is maintainer only)
     +1: danielsh (err->file and err->line are only in maintainer builds.
                   this is about err->message which is valid in all builds)
     -1: stsp (not a bug fix, changes output in a patch release)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1306275, and other revisions
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems such as issue #4421, "diff --summarize of a child of
   a newly added child causes crash" (over HTTP only).
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.
     breser: Not so fond of the temp file use but 1.8.x is out with a much
     better implementation anyway.
