Status of 1.2.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  None

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r14782
    Fix a Perl variable scoping bug in contrib/client-side/svn_load_dirs.pl.in.
    Justification:
      Simple fix in a contrib script requested by a user.

  * r15888
    Complete issue #1361 for JavaHL, removing special handling in the
    JavaHL bindings for 'svn cat -r BASE' in favor of the
    implementation found in the libsvn_client library.
    Justification:
      Remove work-around, unnecessary since SVN 1.2.0, which incurs
      other problems (e.g. EOL-translations, etc.).
    Notes:
      The merge will need to be applied to the fileContent() method,
      rather than to the createReadStream() method (which is new in
      1.3).
      markphip:
      Applied to 1.2.3 tarball and verified that it fixes our problem in
      Subclipse.  We need to use svn cat to feed revisions to Eclipse GUI
      compare/merge engine.  Having incorrect line endings breaks it.

      +1 (non-binding): markphip
