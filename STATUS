   Use `neon-config --libs` when `neon-config --la-file` isn't available.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, cmpilato

 * r30633, r30634
   Make 'svn merge' output state when the merge is from a foreign repository.
   Notes:
     If we don't backport this, we need to increment the @since line
     for svn_wc_notify_foreign_merge_begin.

     +1: cmpilato, pburba

 * r30644
   Make --record-only merges record and elide mergeinfo on subtrees.
   Notes:
     Record only merges without this functionality are a lot less useful.
