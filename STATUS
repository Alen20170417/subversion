for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can

====================================================

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.

     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

 * 1686175, r1687029
   Fix issue #4285, "reintegrate complains about missing ranges from node
   unrelated to branch"
   Justification:
     Reintegrate merge is impossible after the default conflict resolution
     option is applied to a particular tree conflict during a sync merge.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1686554, r1686557, r1686239, r1686541, r1686543, r1686802
   Fix 'svnadmin hotcopy' for read-only FSFS repositories
   Justification:
     Format 7 repositories could not be hotcopied without write access to
     the source repo - which is a regression vs. older formats.  Because
     the new test case also uncovered another regression with hotcopying
     the rep-cache.db from r/o repos.
   Notes:
     The first two revisions contain the actual fix, the others provide a
     test case.  Since the total lines changed is small, the most efficient
     way to review is to via the combined diff.
