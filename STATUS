Status of 1.9.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1705038
   Fix issue 4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1776742, r1776783, r1776788
   Issue #4667: Reduce memory usage during merge, by tighter pool usage.
   Justification:
     With large amounts of mergeinfo, memory usage can be prohibitively high.
     This makes a very significant reduction in certain cases.
   Notes:
     The revisions nominated here are incremental improvements, and can be
     merged either by themselves or along with other revisions that may be
     nominated later. The issue #4667 need not be "closed" for this to be
     a useful backport.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1779948
   Improve error message when copying/moving into unversioned dir.
   Justification:
     The current error message is misleading. It says "not a directory"
     but there is a directory on disk.
     User complained.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

* r1706432
  Fix tests on Windows when passing --bin to win_tests.py.
  Justification:
    Tests should simply work.
  Notes:
    Fixes a bad commandline argument encoding in the Windows test runner.
    Regression introduced in 1.9.2.
  Votes:
    +1: rhuijben, luke1410

 * r1781507
   Fix a NULL deref in libsvn_repos which makes svndumpfilter crash.
   Justification:
     Should not crash. User complained.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1781655
   Improve error message upon failure to open rep-cache.
   Justification:
     The current message lacks sufficient detail to be useful when it appears
     in server logs.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1783704
   Add support to build with 'zlibstat.lib' in install-layout on Windows.
   Justification:
     Simplifies build process on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: luke1410, rhuijben

 * r1759116
   Work around an APR bug in svn_io_file_trunc with buffered r/w files.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, trunc() will leave buffered file objects with
     alternating read and write accesses in an inconsistent state.  Apart
     from being a bug in one of our public APIs, this will cause corruptions
     in FSFS when the strict-rep-sharing patches get backported.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, rhuijben

 * r1785053
   Never attempt to share directory representations in FSFS.
   Justification:
     This fixes inconsistent behavior.  We never add dir reps to the rep-
     cache but would happily share any file or prop rep that happens to
     match the respective directory rep.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1785053
   Notes:
     Will create a text conflict with the strict-rep-sharing patches.
     Depending on which change gets merged first, the respective other
     needs to be updated.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, rhuijben

 * r1785737, r1785738, r1785734, r1786447, r1785754, r1786445, r1786446, r1786515
   Make FSFS consistency no longer depend on hash algorithms.
   Justification:
     This eliminates any existing or future FSFS vulnerability due to
     attacks on MD5 or SHA1.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-strict-rep-sharing
   Notes:
     Depends on r1759116 for correctness with older APR.
     While the backport code is very close to the /trunk changes, it is
     easier to review them as r1786580, r1786581 and r1786619 on the branch.
     Will create a text conflict with the r1785053 backport.  Depending on
     which change gets merged first, the respective other must be updated.

     +1: stefan2, rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)
     -1: brane (Not a valid backport, contrib/ is not in the release tarball.)
