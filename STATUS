Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r16568, r17123
   Make svn info not error out on paths that don't exist in future revs.
   Justification:
     Regression with a simple fix; affects TSVN.
   Notes:
     r16568 is just a docstring fix to avoid conflicts.

 * r17139
   svnmerge.py: Fix traceback on wrong command line.
   Justification:
     While it is not critical, two stupid bugs can cause tracebacks
     instead of nice error messages on wrong command lines.
   Note:
     The fix is pretty safe, and contains a new set of exhaustive
     tests to make sure nothing else is broken about command line
     handling.

Approved changes:

 * r17150
   Fix a bug that caused anonymous write access over ra_svn to
   fail with "Authorization failed" errors.
   Justification:
     Incorrectly denying access is not good.  Also an easy fix.
