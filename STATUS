This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the the time
being applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are
not core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29127, r29135, r29136, r29138, r29163, r29164
   Fix issue #3026: _svn and .svn are silently ignored as file arguments.
   Votes:
     +1: kfogel (r29127, r29163, r29164 only), glasser (all)

 * r29193
   Add "@since" tags to some error codes.
   Notes:
     Depends on the _svn/.svn backport (r29127 et al).
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r29155
   Allow packagers to build some parts of svn against installed svn libs.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r29230-29231, r29233
   Obsessively destroy Neon requests, even in error cases.
   Notes:
     Either r29230 or r29231 prevents a reproducible segfault.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r29329
   Fix regression in svnadmin verify in r24559, new in 1.5.x.  We can
   just roll back 24559 on the 1.5.x branch, but that makes svnadmin
   unusable on large repositories.  We must do one or the other.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r29254, r29255, r29334
   Remove use of an extra RA session.
   Votes:
     +1: hwright, epg

Approved changes:

 * r29194
   Rename an error code.
   Notes:
     Must be reverted on trunk if not backported.
     Depends on r29193 (loosely).
   Votes:
     +1: glasser, epg
