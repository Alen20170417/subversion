Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r13961, r13981
    Make Ruby bindings install to the correct location.
    Justification:
      Broken otherwise. (and _still_ broken with only r13961).
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, epg

  * r13978
    Make copy_tests 25 pass over DAV.
    Justification:
      A failing test looks bad, even more so in a release.
    Notes:
      The problem was in the test, not in Subversion itself.
    Votes:
      +1: kfogel

  * r13983
    Correct valid warnings and bogus compilation errors specific to
    Jikes.
    Justification:
      Avoid warnings (and hard errors!), improve compile times.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r14011
    Rename a locking error code for clarity (LOCKED -> ALREADY_LOCKED).
    Justification:
      It's confusing to those unfamiliar with the locking system.
      (OK, it's only one of many error codes that could be clearer,
      but it had me confused for quite a while. - JAF)
      If we don't do back-port it now while it's new, we can't at all.
