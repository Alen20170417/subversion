Status of 1.10.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1820627
   davautocheck.sh: Support a --lldb option alongside --gdb.
   Justification:
     Will be helpful in debugging backports.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, brane

 * r1823327
   Performance: Make the 'info' command fast on old repository revisions.

     +1: julianfoad, brane

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1822996
   Fix x509 parser to handle RSASSA-PSS certificates.
   Justification:
     JavaHL needs this to handle failure to verify such certs.
     'svn auth' also affected.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben, stsp, brane

 * r1820778
   Make mod_dav_svn report commit capabilities based on SVNMasterVersion.
   Justification:
     Allows 1.10 write-through proxy to 1.9 master.
   Notes:
     I believe this is a release blocker, without it we break backward
     compatibilty for write-through proxies.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben, stsp

 * r1820044
   Make 'svn shelves' diffstat output show WC-relative paths.
