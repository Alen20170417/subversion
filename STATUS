This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30746, r30747
   Fix a minor merge range notification header bug.
   Notes:
     r30747 is just cleanup of some cruft that snuck in with r30746,
     thus adhering to my "every commit should need a follow-up" ethos.

 * r30949, r30962
   Fix issue #3188.  Mergeinfo on switched targets/subtrees should elide

Approved changes (all releases):
================================

 * r31004
   Fix the ruby bindings to account for the API change merged in r30975.
   Notes:
     Without this, a bindings test fails, so this should be considered a
     blocker.

 * r31006
   Fix svn_error_t leak in Perl bindings test.
   Notes:
     Probably falls under the same category as 31004
