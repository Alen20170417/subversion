This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1694194
   Correct a parameter name in svn_repos_get_fs_build_parser5.
   Justification:
     The docstring shall match the actual declaration.
   Note:
     This is not an API change as it does not affect any user of that
     function nor does it break binary compatibility.  To keep the code
     churn low, the implementation has not been updated - it happens to
     use "parser" as the name of a local variable.

 * r1694481, r1697824
   Fix Unix build on systems without GPG agent.
   Justification:
     This is a user-reported issue.
   Votes:
     +1: brane
     +1: stefan2, philip (without r1697824)

 * r1694533
   Fix alignment fault in ra_svn on 32 bit SPARC machines.
   Justification:
     RA_svn is basically unusuable on that platform.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +1: rhuijben (Would prefer clarity over the tiny performance improvement)
     -0: brane (the performance hack should be in apr_array_make,
                not in Subversion.)

 * r1695022
   Fix incomplete membuffer cache initialization.
   Justification:
     Most users won't be hit by this because the OS hands out nicely zeroed
     memory pages which we won't recycle until the end of the process. So,
     this problem primarily hits people running a setup that deliberately
     poisons memory upon allocation (APR pool debugging, MSVC debug malloc).
     However, those who use very small caches and initialize them late in
     the application's lifetime, might get recycled / "dirty" memory blocks
     as well ending up with segfaults etc.

     +1: stefan2, brane

 * r1687304,1687389,1693135,1693138,1693159,1695600,1695606,1695681
   Better configure detection of httpd version and auth fix.
   Justification:
     Build out-of-the box on more platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, stefan2

 * r1697381, r1697384, r1697387
   Make 'svnfsfs load-index' work as advertised in the documentation
   Justification:
     svnfsfs load-index would only ever be used in high-stress situations
     like desaster recovery.  So, while workarounds are possible, having
     people jump though a few extra hoops is a bad thing in that context.
