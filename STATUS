This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520
   Silence compiler warnings.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     -0: philip, brane (see dev thread: it's a false alarm, wrong value)

 * r1470246
   Improve the interactive resolution of property conflicts.  Instead of
   showing the contents of the '.prej' file once for each prop conflict, show
   initially a single line such as
     "local delete, incoming edit upon merge"
   (similar to resolving a text conflict) and allow the user to display a 3-way
   diff by adding a 'dc - display conflict' option.
   Justification:
     Showing the whole .prej file each time was confusing and ugly when more
     than one property was in conflict.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad
     +1: stsp (for 1.8.0, but not any 1.8.x since it changes the UI)

 * r1477294, r1480616, r1480641, r1480642, r1480664, r1480669
   Further improvements for interactive resolution of property conflicts.
   Allow conflicted properties to be edited and resolved to the edited value.
   Justification:
     This is a usability enhancement we could make in 1.8.0.
     It also fixes a bug in libsvn_wc where it doesn't use results provided
     by the conflict callback (see r1480641), which might help API consumers.
   Notes:
     This group depends on r1470246.
     r1477294 and r1480616 are merged to avoid text conflicts from refactoring.
     r1480641 and r1480642 are the main changes.
     The other revisions are small follow-up fixes.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (for 1.8.0, but not any 1.8.x since it changes the UI)
     +1: steveking

 * r1469363, r1469645, r1469674, r1470037, r1470537, r1478220, r1478221,
   r1478465, r1478998, r1480723
   Fix issue #4355 'svn_client_log5 broken with multiple revisions which
   span a rename'.
   Justification:
     svn_client_log5 doesn't deliver what it promises, see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4355#desc1 for
     a brief example of the problem.
   Notes:
     r1469363, r1469645, r1469674, r1470037, and r1470537 are the creation
     and subsequent tweaks of a single new log test for this issue.  r1478220
     is the fix.  r1478221, r1478465, r1478998, and r1480723 are (mostly)
     minor follow-ups to that fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1479320, r1479321, r1479323, r1479326, r1479329
   Silence 'make -s clean distclean'.
   Justification:
     'make -s all install distclean' would spam stdout and issue irrelevant
     warnings on stderr.  (This is user-facing behaviour.)
   Votes:
     +1 (for 1.8.1): danielsh

 * r1479896
   Sort directory entries in output of 'svnlook tree'.
   Justification:
     Unstable APR hash order causes unstable output.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1480077
   Check separately for -flto and -Wno-clobbered with --enable-optimize.
   Justification:
     The -flto flag was not used by older compilers that do not
     suport -Wno-clobbered, even when they do support -flto.
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)

 * r1480080
   Instruct clang to not warn about unknown warning flags.
   Justification:
     Newer versions of clang accept warning flags that they do not
     support, but emit warnings about them instead -- making the
     compile output a mess with a warning emitted for every
     single C and C++ file in an optimized build (because
     of the -Wno-clobbered, see above).
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)

 * r1481010
   Fix issue 4365, multi-threaded svnserve pool memory use after clear.
   Justification:
     SEGV, particularly on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, danielsh

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1477876, r1477891, r1478001
   Fix a bug whereby a property conflict description always reported
     'unknown' for the node kind. Add a test which catches that bug.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1477876
   Notes:
     The fix is in r1477876, and the branch was needed to resolve conflicts
     (rather than porting prior changes on which it depended). The test is
     in r1478001, and it depends on the test file changes made in r1477891.
   Votes:
     -1: julianfoad ('svn update' now crashes on interactive resolution of a
                     prop conflict)

Approved changes:
=================

# 1.8.0-rc1 is being voted on currently and as such 1.8.0 is in the soak phase.
# Changes that are not intended for 1.8.0 should not be placed here and changes
# that would restart the soak should not be added unless they are resolving
# blocking issues.  If in doubt see this link for details:
# http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
