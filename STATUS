Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r13930
    In the help for `svnadmin create`, show the default file
    system backend type for the --fs-type option.
    Justification: That we did not previously display this info was
      likely legacy; it should've been added with the introduction
      of fsfs.  As the default to fsfs is a change in behavior for
      1.2.0, it's now especially important to display this info.
