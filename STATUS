Status of 1.7.19:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1438879
   Make 'show-diff' at the interactive conflict prompt show nicer diffs.
   Justification:
     'show-diff' produces unreadable diffs in some cases, especially with
     conflicts recorded during merges.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1438879
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +0: rhuijben (Shouldn't we provide a three way diff instead of guessing
                   a base to show a one way diff against based on the
                   operation?
                   
                   I would prefer to have show-diff always work against
                   the local pristine version, instead of sometimes against
                   their or their-old (src-left) version, as that is the final
                   change I would commit.)

 * r1461760
   Additional fix related to issue #4340, "filenames containing \n corrupt
   FSFS repositories"
   Justification:
     This change makes libsvn_repos block filenames containing control
     characters. Control characters in filenames have always been rejected
     by libsvn_client, but client-side software bypassing libsvn_client
     could still commit such filenames. Control characters in filenames
     can cause problems not just in FSFS but also in dump files, unidiff,
     and possibly elsewhere. It is a good idea to make the client and
     server consistent.
     See discussion linked from issue #4340 for more information.

   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: danielsh (restrictions not suitable for introduction in patch release;
                   dev@ thread started 2013/05/10 9pm)

 * r1542610, r1564576, r1568180
   Add missing description to build.conf, to properly generate a version
   resource (including icon) for this executable on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, breser

 * r1555491
   Fix svn_fs_close_root for FSFS transaction roots.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, cache-related pool cleanups may be run after the
     svn_fs_t object has been destroyed.  I.e. even with explicit calls to
     svn_fs_close_root, the user may see a segfault.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1555491
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser
     -0: rhuijben (Seems to be a different name for the same pool. See 1.8?)

 * r1542765, r1571214
   Add Sqlite index information.
   Justification:
     Adding this information explains to Sqlite how we use our indexes. While
     Subversion 1.7 doesn't depend on this as much as 1.8 as we didn't tune the
     queries as much at that time, this information will make several queries
     use indexes instead of table scans.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1542765
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1574868
   Don't let invalid mergeinfo stop 'svnadmin dump' from producing a dump.
     Part of issue #4476 "Mergeinfo containing r0 makes svnsync and svnadmin
     dump fail".
   Justification:
     A formatting error in what is essentially client-side metadata, albeit
     with repository-side interpretation as well, should never prevent
     dumping the repository. This issue only occurs when svnadmin is trying
     to warn us of mergeinfo revisions that might be unexpected, so it is
     not essential.
   Notes:
     There is a work-around, at least in theory: a dump starting from
     revision 0 or 1 does not suffer from this problem.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1574868
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben

 * r1591123
   Display the proper URL for 'svn rm URL' in the commit log editor.
   Justification:
     It's confusing since the URL isn't what the user passed.  Regression since
     1.7.9 when we fixed issue #4332.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, rhuijben

 * r1594156
   Fix a problem with the Unix build that could result in linking to the wrong
   Subversion libraries at build time or at run time.
   Justification:
     Building and testing should Just Work as far as possible.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1594157
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1595431
   Use a proper intermediate directory when building with VS 2003-2008.
   Justification:
     Reported as a build problem by some of our usual dist signers.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1462041
   Fix issue issue 4339, diff suffix scanning invalid read at last chunk
   boundary.
   Justification:
     Without this patch we access memory that isn't part of the diff, which
     in some cases causes a segfault.
   Notes:
     This branch only merges the actual fix. Trunk and 1.8.x have a test
     for this case.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1462041
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp

 * r1637826
   Fix typos in LIBTOOL_M4 and LIBTOOL_CONFIG expansion in autogen.sh
   Justification:
     Makes no sense to tell users to set environment variables
     to fix builds with libtool in a nonstandard location, if we
     then don't interpret said environment variables correctly.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1409804
   Add a delimiter between the two chains in svn_error_compose_create().
   Justification:
     Allow users to tell where the second error chain starts -- avoids
     misrepresentation that the first error is caused by the second.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (I'm not sure if this should be in a patch release and the
                   stacktrace where this refers to is maintainer only)
     +1: danielsh (err->file and err->line are only in maintainer builds.
                   this is about err->message which is valid in all builds)
     -1: stsp (not a bug fix, changes output in a patch release)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1636874
   Provide @since information in svn_stream_skip docstring.
   Justification:
     Our API docs should be accurate.

     +1: stefan2, julianfoad
