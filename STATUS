This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1693886
   Fix an error leak in FSFS verification.
   Justification:
     Don't have memory leaks.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, philip

 * r1694194
   Correct a parameter name in svn_repos_get_fs_build_parser5.
   Justification:
     The docstring shall match the actual declaration.
   Note:
     This is not an API change as it does not affect any user of that
     function nor does it break binary compatibility.  To keep the code
     churn low, the implementation has not been updated - it happens to
     use "parser" as the name of a local variable.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1694481
   Fix Unix build on systems without GPG agent.
   Justification:
     This is a user-reported issue.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, philip

 * r1694533
   Fix alignment fault in ra_svn on 32 bit SPARC machines.
   Justification:
     RA_svn is basically unusuable on that platform.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +1: rhuijben (Would prefer clarity over the tiny performance improvement)

 * r1695022
   Fix incomplete membuffer cache initialization.
   Justification:
     Most users won't be hit by this because the OS hands out nicely zeroed
     memory pages which we won't recycle until the end of the process. So,
     this problem primarily hits people running a setup that deliberately
     poisons memory upon allocation (APR pool debugging, MSVC debug malloc).
     However, those who use very small caches and initialize them late in
     the application's lifetime, might get recycled / "dirty" memory blocks
     as well ending up with segfaults etc.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1687304,1687389,1693135,1693138,1693159,1695600,1695606,1695681
   Better configure detection of httpd version and auth fix.
   Justification:
     Build out-of-the box on more platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, stefan2

 * r1696387
   Expose expat and zlib versions in svn --version --verbose
   Justification:
     Without a patch these numbers aren't visible in Windows distributions,
     which usually link these dependencies statically.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1696695
   Resolve circular library reference in libsvn_fs_x
   Justification:
     Causes library load failures on at least some Linux setups.
     [The only reason it doesn't fail on Windows is that we currently link
      libsvn_fs* into a single .dll]
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1697381, r1697384, r1697387
   Make 'svnfsfs load-index' work as advertised in the documentation
   Justification:
     svnfsfs load-index would only ever be used in high-stress situations
     like desaster recovery.  So, while workarounds are possible, having
     people jump though a few extra hoops is a bad thing in that context.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1691928
   Fix issue #4584, "Non-canonical $HOME crashes GPG-agent support code".
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.8.11. Simple cause; simple fix.
   Notes:
     Also nominated for 1.8.x.
     Trunk has a better fix, but less suitable for backporting, in r1691952.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, philip, stefan2
     +1: danielsh (either with or without r1691952; haven't tried to reproduce,
                   only reviewed the diff)
     +0: rhuijben (Can't test this part. +1 on the combination with r1691952.
                   I don't see returning a properly canonicalized path
                   instead of a potentially non canonical path as a breaking
                   change that can't be backported. I would call it a bugfix
                   that should be backported)

 * r1696222, r1696225
   Implement polling on named pipes on Windows to resolve svn+ssh:// problems
   Justification:
     Without this patch operations like checkout just fail with an error.
     This is a regression as older Subversion releases ignored the error.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, brane, stefan2

 * r1694929
   Fix memory corruption in SWIG bindings' svn_client_copy_source_t
   constructor.
   Justification:
     Constructor result is not correct as REVISION gets partially overwritten
     by PEG_REVISION. May also result in segfaults.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, philip
     +0.5: rhuijben (Minimal review)
