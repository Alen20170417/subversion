This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16898
    Restore definitions of apr_pool_destroy and apr_pool_clear for
    compatibility with Subversion 1.2.x.
    Justification:
      Necessary for compatibility with Trac 0.9b2. Trivial change.

  * r16903
    Remove spurious dependencies on APR in the SWIG code and build
    scripts, that prevent running autogen.sh --release through to
    completion.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r16903
    Justification:
      We can't release a tarball that doesn't depend on SWIG without
      this, because apr.h is system-dependent.
    Notes:
      Change backported in branches/1.3.x-r16903 to resolve conflicts
      with regard to the altered build system in trunk.

  * r16904
    Use SWIG_PY_COMPILE and SWIG_RB_COMPILE when compiling SWIG
    libraries for Python and Ruby.
    Justification:
      If SWIG Python helper libraries need -fno-strict-aliasing to
      compile correctly, SWIG_PY_COMPILE should contain this option.
      It's also possible that SWIG_RB_COMPILE could contain needed
      switches, so we might as well be consistent.
