Status of 1.8.15:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser
     -0: julianfoad (test is missing from branch -- how do we know it works?)

 * r1618472, r1618841, r1632635, r1640832
   Fix a segfault with old style text delta.
   Justification:
     Compiling with -O3 in GCC 4.9 produces code that segfaults.  The newer
     1.9 / trunk code is simpler and compiles just fine.  Also, that code
     section is no longer performance critical.
   Notes:
     The branch code in text_delta is now the same as 1.9 / trunk, except for
     a stream API usage and an unused function.
   Branch:

 * r1654932, r1654933, r1654934, r1654937
   Fix issue #4554, "0 file length reported in FSFS".
   Justification:
     This causes 'svnadmin dump' to create corrupted output that fails to
     load and we provide no way to detect that problem other than loading
     the respective dump.  We also want to prevent further instances of
     that issue to be added to the repository.
   Notes:
     r1561419 has been removed from this change set and proposed for a
     separate backport because it is not a necessary part of the #4554 fix.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4554-v2
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2
     +0: danielsh (hard to review all potential causes of expanded_size==0 in
                   7*3*2 cases (1.1…1.8) × (file/dir/prop rep) × (plain/delta))

 * r1666965, r1667120
   Reduce 'the lag' of the first svn log results over mod_dav.
   Justification:
     A slow svn log makes users call Subversion slow. This fixes the
     perceived performance problem by no longer optimizing just for
     obtaining all the results fast, but also for obtaining the first
     result fast.
     .
     Just the perceived slowness of common svn log operations might
     make users switch to a DVCS or implement a client side cache,
     while this slowness is just a buffering to make the total set of
     results come in faster. But I don't think there are that many users
     that really wait for all results of
     .
     $ svn log -q ^/subversion/trunk
     .
     This currently takes > 10 seconds before the first result using
     the EU mirror for me. With --limit 1 (best comparison with post-patch)
     that would be 0.2 seconds.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip (After it has been approved for 1.9)
     -0.5: ivan (It's not security or bug fix. The change itself a little
                 bit controversial for me, so it's better to release it as
                 part of Subversion 1.9.0)

 * r1669955
   Reduce FSFS memory allocation in Apache with unbounded MaxFreeMem.
   Justification:
     A user reported that their worker processes ran OOM with Apache 2.2
     in default configuration when fulltext caching was enabled. Although
     people should set MaxFreeMem to something other than 0, we should
     play nice with out-of-the-box setups.
     The patch itself is relatively low-risk (changes initial buffer size).
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-memory-fragmentation
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, brane

 * r1687812
   mod_dav_svn: Use LimitXMLRequestBody httpd directive to control maximum
   length of skel-encoded request bodies.
   Justification:
     Allow administrators to setup configurable limits on the size of
     skel-encoded requests.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan, rhuijben

 * r1691928
   Fix issue #4584, "Non-canonical $HOME crashes GPG-agent support code".
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.8.11. Simple cause; simple fix.
   Notes:
     Also nominated for 1.9.x.
     Trunk has a better fix, but less suitable for backporting, in r1691952.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, philip

 * r1694929
   Fix memory corruption in SWIG bindings' svn_client_copy_source_t
   constructor.
   Justification:
     Constructor result is not correct as REVISION gets partially overwritten
     by PEG_REVISION. May also result in segfaults.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, philip

 * r1687304,1687389,1693135,1693138,1693159,1695600,1695606,1695681
   Better configure detection of httpd version and auth fix.
   Justification:
     Build out-of-the box on more platforms.
