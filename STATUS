Status of 1.9.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1705038
   Fix issue 4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1774109
   Document the purpose of 'svnadmin freeze' more clearly.
   Justification:
     Not very important, nice to have documentation fix. Trivial merge.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, julianfoad

 * r1776742, r1776783, r1776788
   Issue #4667: Reduce memory usage during merge, by tighter pool usage.
   Justification:
     With large amounts of mergeinfo, memory usage can be prohibitively high.
     This makes a very significant reduction in certain cases.
   Notes:
     The revisions nominated here are incremental improvements, and can be
     merged either by themselves or along with other revisions that may be
     nominated later. The issue #4667 need not be "closed" for this to be
     a useful backport.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1779948
   Improve error message when copying/moving into unversioned dir.
   Justification:
     The current error message is misleading. It says "not a directory"
     but there is a directory on disk.
     User complained.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

* r1706432
  Fix tests erroring out, if using the --bin option.
  Justification:
    Tests should simply work.
  Votes:
    +1 (non-binding): luke1410

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)
     -1: brane (Not a valid backport, contrib/ is not in the release tarball.)
