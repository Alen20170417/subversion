This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30746, r30747
   Fix a minor merge range notification header bug.
   Notes:
     r30747 is just cleanup of some cruft that snuck in with r30746,
     thus adhering to my "every commit should need a follow-up" ethos.

Approved changes (all releases):
================================

 * r31018
   Fix svn_ra_open3() doc string to say "@since 1.5" not "@since 1.6".
   Notes: This falls into hacking.html's no-vote-necessary category.
     Since I'm nominating it anyway, I'll record my vote, but I'm
     just filing it directly in the Approved section.
