Status of 1.8.11:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: ivan, brane (not regression from 1.7.x,
                      destructive change in libsvn_wc core)
     -0: rhuijben (temporarily remove my +1 until I complete investigating
                   a related problem. It looks like this fix doesn't work for
                   the user scenario it was intended for)

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +0: breser (I'd be +1 if not for the unused function in svnadmin_tests.py;
                 without r1640560)

 * r1555491
   Fix svn_fs_close_root for FSFS transaction roots.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, cache-related pool cleanups may be run after the
     svn_fs_t object has been destroyed.  I.e. even with explicit calls to
     svn_fs_close_root, the user may see a segfault.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1555491
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     -0: philip, rhuijben (Seems to be a different name for the same pool?)

 * r1590751
   Use empty, rather than NULL, config if default is unreadable.
   Justification:
     svn SEGV reported by user.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -0: julianfoad (prefer to fix all the programs at the same time;
                     other queries -- see email thread)

 * r1621978, r1621981
   Fix changelist filtering for repos-WC and WC-WC diffs.
   Justification:
     Changelist filtering, enabled by "svn diff --cl foo" for example, was
     broken (it crashed in common cases) and incomplete even if the crash
     were avoided. See email thread "Segmentation fault during diff generation"
     starting at <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2014-08/0325.shtml>.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1621978
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben

 * r1625533, r1625537
   Keep externals registrations on 'svn upgrade' (part of issue 4519)
   Justification:
     'svn upgrade' shouldn't destroy valid information.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1628536
   Fix issue #4085, "external can shadow a versioned directory".
   Justification:
     Bug that can lead to a working copy which cannot be updated
     until a directory shadowing an external, which was switched
     to the external's location by the externals handling code,
     is switched back to its original path.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1633126
   Improve performance of recorded timestamp fixups in svn cleanup
   Justification:
     Fixing timestamps on a working copy with properly recorded timestamps
     should not cost 10* the time of walking the working copy for status.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1633126
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1637826
   Fix typos in LIBTOOL_M4 and LIBTOOL_CONFIG expansion in autogen.sh
   Justification:
     Makes no sense to tell users to set environment variables
     to fix builds with libtool in a nonstandard location, if we
     then don't interpret said environment variables correctly.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1561419, r1561427, 1547489, r1560643, r1573744
   Fix the hotcopy and recovery for pre-1.4 FSFS repositories.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1573744-and-friends
   Justification:
     Without this, old SVN versions won't be able to e.g. hotcopy those
     repos once 1.8.x made a commit in them.  Also, fix our hotcopy code
     and make it cope with repositories broken by previous 1.8.x releases.
   Notes:
     The best way to review this is to review the backporting result in
     r1640603 instead of inspecting the original patches.
     "r1573744" is a bit of a misnomer as only the test case got backported
     because the workflow problem fixed by it does not exist in 1.8.x.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -1: breser (see my email to dev@, <5282FE15.40505@reser.org>)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1620332
   Remove broken conflict resolver menu options.
   Justification:
     svn shouldn't offer menu options that always error out.
   Notes:
     Run merge with --accept theirs-conflict
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, julianfoad, stefan2

 * r1542610, r1564576, r1568180
   Add missing description to build.conf, to properly generate a version
   resource (including icon) for this executable on Windows.
   Notes:
     r1564576 breaks compilation on Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013 of
     this project. r1568180 fixes this problem.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, breser, stefan2
     +1: (without r1564576, r1568180): stsp

 * r1600331, r1600348, 1600368, r1600563, r1600781
   Improve gpg-agent support.
   Justification: Avoids spurious error logs, supports standard socket
     locations and removes double prompts from pinentry.  Without these
     changes it's far less desireable to use.
   Notes:
     Branch is needed since SVN_VA_NULL is not available in 1.8.x.
     This does change the behavior of gpg-agent from prompting twice
     for the password with pinentry to confirm the user hasn't entered
     an incorrect password to instead clearing bad cached passwords and
     reprompting.  See my email on the subject: https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201406.mbox/%3C538D2BE5.3070706%40reser.org%3E
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-gpg-agent
   Votes:
     +1: breser, philip, stefan2

 * r1619380, r1619393
   Fix diff of a locally copied directory with props: it showed all props
   as added instead of a diff against the copy-from props.
   Justification:
     Behaviour regression introduced in 1.8.0.
   Notes:
     r1619380 is the fix; r1619393 a test for it.
     The test on trunk@1619393 is tweaked to account for a trunk bug in the
     display of diff headers; the backport branch provides the correct
     version for 1.8.x.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1611379
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben, stefan2
