This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20781
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.

Approved changes:

  * r20787
    svn_apply_autoprops.py: Patch to trim leading and trailing
    whitespace from property names and values.  Without this, any
    whitespace in the autoprops section of $HOME/.subversion/config
    will end up in the property name and/or value.
    Justification:
      Nice correctness fix.  Lives in contrib section.
