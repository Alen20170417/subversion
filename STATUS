Status of 1.9.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1698312, r1702310
   Correctly report empty representations in 'svnfsfs stats'.
   Justification:
     The current code displays the "0" bracket in histograms as
     "-2147483648 .. < 1" instead of "0 .. < 1".  Technically correct
     but annoying.  UI change only.

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)

 * r1700215, r1700219, r1700220, r1701270
   Fix argument passing in test suite.
   Justification:
     Makes svnfsfs_tests.py work in fsfs-v4 and fsfs-v6 modes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1700215
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Log level on standard invocation of win-tests.py changes)

 * r1701598, r1701603, r1701611, r1701646
   Make 'svn lock' and 'svn unlock' report (un)lock errors as failure
   Justification:
     A single lock or unlock failure doesn't affect the whole operation
     since 1.9, but this has the side effect of no longer producing an
     error at all on failures. This patch makes 'svn' return an error when
     at least one failure is reported by the locking code.
   Notes:
     r1701598 is the actual fix. The other patches simplify and fix
     test expectations.
   Votes:
     +0.9: rhuijben (Minor behavior change. Needs more dev@ discussion)

 * r1702237, r1702238, r1702239
   Resolve using uninitialized conflict when non-recursive reverting move
   Justification:
     Segfault. User reported.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1702218, r1702474, r1702478
   Fix segfault in 'svn upgrade' of pre-Subversion 1.3 working copies with
   externals.
   Justification:
     Segfault. User reported.
   Notes:
     r1702218 fixes the problem.
     r1702474 and r1702478 adds a testcase.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan, rhuijben

 * r1702533
   Expose utf8proc version information via 'svn --version --verbose'
   Justification:
     There is no way to retrieve this from the binaries.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1701638
   Remove unneeded io operation on pristine install
   Justification:
     Every IO operation counts in checkout performance. Doing something
     that is never necessary just slows things down. (The rename handling
     would handle read-only just fine... And matching SHA-1 is handled at
     a higher level)

     +1: rhuijben, ivan, stefan2

 * r1701997
   Fix crash due access to uninitialized pointer.
   Justification:
     Access to uninitialized pointer is some unknown conditions. Reported
     multiple times using TortoiseSVN crash reporter tool.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan, rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1702247
   Resolve segfault incoming delete of tree containing switched paths
   Justification:
     Segfault. User reported.
