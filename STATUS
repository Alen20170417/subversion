Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1200277, r1243694, r1243840, r1243920, r1244466, r1244551
   Workaround for issue #4087, "bogus repos_id in wc.db for file externals"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. Some repositories with file externals cannot be
     checked out with 1.7. Users complained.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-12/0299.shtml
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4087
   Notes:
     r1200277 was merged to simplify conflict resolution
     r1243694 implements the workaround
     r1243840 is a cosmetic follow-up treak
     r1243920 was merged for conflict resolution for r1244466
     r1244466 eliminates an unneccesary RA round-trip from r1243694
     r1244551 uses a better API to query the local repos root and uuid

 * r1291594
   Support httpd-2.4 in davautocheck.

     Allow testing against imminently current stable httpd.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1291797, r1291810
   On Windows detect where perl is installed and add this information to the
   include and lib directory settings of the swig-perl projects.
   Justification:
     Allows building swig-perl without copying perl libraries manually.
     Somehow required on the Windows buildbot since the last library version
     bump.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1233292, r1245711, r1245746, r1245764, r1245809, r1245929, r1245935, r1293577
   Fix various problems with symlinks pointing at externals (issue #4102).
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6.x. Users complained:
     http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2012-02/0266.shtml
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4102
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1293945, r1293972, r1293976, r1293998, r1294136, r1294236;
   r1294134, r1294147, r1294364, rXXX
   Two interdependent changes:
   Fix issue #4121: copy followed by delete of unreadable child.
   Fix svn:// authz in Python tests.
   Justification:
     User resorted to patching the commit editor to work around this.
     Tests are broken.
   Notes:
     r1293945,r1293972,r1293976 are cosmetics.
     r1293998 is the fix.
     r1294136 is a test.
     r1294236 fixes an uninitialized variable.
   Notes:
     r1294134 extends a test to demonstrate its brokenness.
     r1294147 fixes said brokenness.
     r1294364 is included to avoid conflicts with rXXX.
     rXXX fixes r1294147 for Windows.

 * r1294470
   Include more information in the FSFS node-revision predecessors count sanity
   check.
   Justification:
     Will make chasing down the bug easier.  (I mean, asking users to run a
     Perl script that dumps node-revisions? Really?)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein
     -1: rhuijben (Keep the candidate list readable, by removing unneeded
                   backports. Should be part of the backport change when
                   needed)

 * r1235831, r1236099
   Tweak the parsing of the ssl-authority-files config option to make it
   easier for users to configure.
   Justification:
     Low impact change to help users.
   Notes:
     Both r1235831 and r1236099 conflict and will need a branch.
   Votes:
     +1: gstein, rhuijben, steveking
     -1: julianfoad, stsp (not forward-compatible within 1.7.x; discussing in email)
