This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.0:

1.9.0 release blockers:
=======================

 * r1663338, r1663347
   Properly record resolving of individual property conflicts.
   Justification:
     Fixes a few implementation bugs in the resolver code and exposes the
     api for more users than those that pass a callback function.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1663450
   Fix removing cache tokens in the ra_svn editor implementation
   Justification:
     Unbounded memory usage and potential access to invalid memory.
   Notes:
     This regression was introduced in r1658194. Reverting this change
     is just as valid as backporting this fix.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip
     -0: ivan (prefer r1658194 micro-optimization to be reverted)

 * r1664078,r1664080,r1664187,r1664191,r1664200,r1664344
   Instead of making more changes to the auth batons from ra sessions, reduce
   the number of changes by introducing an internal slave auth baton feature.
   Justification:
     Without this patch (or a complete redesign of the auth layer), the
     ra sessions cache (currently on a feature branch), will open the ra
     sessions from outside configuration changes caused by opening other
     ra sessions. This patch not only reverts the additional changes to the
     auth baton on init that are new in 1.9, but also removes cases where we
     already applied similar changes inside specific ra providers.
   Notes:
     The reason I group this under release blockers, is to avoid the behavior
     change introduced in r1609499 from reaching released versions. The changes
     itself are safe for a later backport as it only affects ra-session
     internal state.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1663183, r1663184
   Introduce build support for Visual Studio "2015"
   Justification:
     Unbreaks building with the VS version that should be released somewhere
     later this year.
   Notes:
     Includes a few generator fixes, and compilation fixes of utf8proc.c
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1663671
   Improve obstructing working copy detection in the update editor
   Justification:
     Avoids doing unrecoverable damage to wc.db on invalid editor
     operations in cases where that isn't necessary. Github's
     Subversion compatibility triggers this problem in some sparse
     working copy scenarios.
   Notes:
     This is not a regression against 1.8.x.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1663791
   Trivial typo fix in error message.
   Justification:
     Fixes a typo.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, rhuijben

 * r1663991
   Fix calculating the repository path after commits of nodes that are
   shadowing a switched (not-present) node.
   Justification:
     Allows introducing repository paths in the working copy, that don't
     reflect the repository state.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1664035
   Keep track of changes when a file external is replace by a real file
   Justification:
     When a file-external is deleted, there might be a real node that
     want to take its place. This patch makes svn update introduce a
     not present marker node, so a follow-up update will bring in the
     new file (that was previously reported as skipped)
   Notes:
     To implement this some features had to be added to the generic
     base remove function.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1663738
   Stop exposing and prohibit changing internal txn props through FS API
   Justification:
     Prevents an implementation detail leak.  Prohibits changing the
     internal behavior of our transactions via public API.  Avoids a situation
     with the API function call discarding the data and falsely reporting
     success for "set" operations with 'svn:client-date' properties, i.e.,
     with the API telling us that the operation completed successfully when
     the change itself was not applied.  (The last part is new-in-1.9.)
   Notes:
     While this is mostly an API correctness fix, there is a user-visible
     consequence of 'svnlook proplist' no longer leaking internal properties
     like svn:check-locks for transactions.
   Votes:
     +1: kotkov, rhuijben
     +0: philip (the new behaviour is fine but so is the old behaviour.
         svn:client-date is internal so does not have to obey the
         rules that apply to user properties. The proplist "leak" is
         strictly a regression as it is no longer possible to determine
         whether the CHECK_LOCKS flag is set on a txn.)

 * r1664193
   Fix win32 resource generation for svnbench.exe
   Justification:
     Trivial change to generate version resource for application.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================


Approved changes:
=================

 * r1663003
   info --show-item: Change 'last-changed-rev' to 'last-changed-revision'.
   Justification (for being a freeze exception):
     API change.
   Justification (general):
     Longer-hand spelling is clearer and more self-explanatory.
   Notes:
     API change (can't be merged after 1.9.0).
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, brane, rhuijben

 * r1663697, r1663706, r1663749
   Set svn:date earlier when creating a BDB txn.
   Justification:
     Required for new-in-1.9 svn:client-date to work properly on BDB.
   Notes:
     r1663697 is the fix for this problem, r1663706 and r1663749 add a test.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben, kotkov

 * r1664084, r1664085
   Reduce memory footprint of svn_repos_deleted_rev().
   Justification:
     Unbounded memory usage. Regression since 1.8.x. Simple fix that keeps
     memory usage limited in a loop.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan, stefan2
