This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.17:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1438879
   Make 'show-diff' at the interactive conflict prompt show nicer diffs.
   Justification:
     'show-diff' produces unreadable diffs in some cases, especially with
     conflicts recorded during merges.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1438879
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +0: rhuijben (Shouldn't we provide a three way diff instead of guessing
                   a base to show a one way diff against based on the
                   operation?
                   
                   I would prefer to have show-diff always work against
                   the local pristine version, instead of sometimes against
                   their or their-old (src-left) version, as that is the final
                   change I would commit.)

 * r1461760
   Additional fix related to issue #4340, "filenames containing \n corrupt
   FSFS repositories"
   Justification:
     This change makes libsvn_repos block filenames containing control
     characters. Control characters in filenames have always been rejected
     by libsvn_client, but client-side software bypassing libsvn_client
     could still commit such filenames. Control characters in filenames
     can cause problems not just in FSFS but also in dump files, unidiff,
     and possibly elsewhere. It is a good idea to make the client and
     server consistent.
     See discussion linked from issue #4340 for more information.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4340-repos
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: danielsh (restrictions not suitable for introduction in patch release;
                   dev@ thread started 2013/05/10 9pm)

 * r1542610, r1564576, r1568180
   Add missing description to build.conf, to properly generate a version
   resource (including icon) for this executable on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1 (without r1568180): breser
     +1: rhuijben

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-serf-1.3.x-Windows
   Allow compiling against Serf 1.3.x
   Notes:
     Backport of the 1.8 fixes, plus a few more fixes in order not to
     break the neon compilation which also hooks into zlib.
   Justification:
     (Without this patch the Windows buildbot remains broken for serf with 1.7,
      as recent Subversion versions require serf 1.3.x)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, jcorvel

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1551579
   Fix moving files from externals to ancestor directories and vice versa.
   Justification:
     "Moves should just work" or "be nice to api users, like Markus"
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, breser
     +1 (non-binding): schabi (Fixes our use case, all our other tests pass.)

 * r1555491
   Fix svn_fs_close_root for FSFS transaction roots.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, cache-related pool cleanups may be run after the
     svn_fs_t object has been destroyed.  I.e. even with explicit calls to
     svn_fs_close_root, the user may see a segfault.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1555491
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser
     -0: rhuijben (Seems to be a different name for the same pool. See 1.8?)

 * r1542765, r1571214
   Add Sqlite index information.
   Justification:
     Adding this information explains to Sqlite how we use our indexes. While
     Subversion 1.7 doesn't depend on this as much as 1.8 as we didn't tune the
     queries as much at that time, this information will make several queries
     use indexes instead of table scans.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1542765
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1574868
   Don't let invalid mergeinfo stop 'svnadmin dump' from producing a dump.
     Part of issue #4476 "Mergeinfo containing r0 makes svnsync and svnadmin
     dump fail".
   Justification:
     A formatting error in what is essentially client-side metadata, albeit
     with repository-side interpretation as well, should never prevent
     dumping the repository. This issue only occurs when svnadmin is trying
     to warn us of mergeinfo revisions that might be unexpected, so it is
     not essential.
   Notes:
     There is a work-around, at least in theory: a dump starting from
     revision 0 or 1 does not suffer from this problem.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1574868
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1580626, r1580650
   Fix 'svn copy URL WC' after the working copy is relocated
   Justification:
     Without this patch (which is a followup of 1560690 backported in 1.7.16),
     descendants of copies in a relocated working copy are marked as incomplete
     (and these nodes are all created at their own op-depth)
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1580626
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1577200
   Fix libmagic detection with custom LDFLAGS.
   Justification:
     Fixes libmagic detection where configure relies on LDFLAGS
     to find libraries in non-standard locations.
     This should allow the bb-openbsd buildbot to compile 1.7.x.
   Votes:
    +1: stsp

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1409804
   Add a delimiter between the two chains in svn_error_compose_create().
   Justification:
     Allow users to tell where the second error chain starts -- avoids
     misrepresentation that the first error is caused by the second.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (I'm not sure if this should be in a patch release and the
                   stacktrace where this refers to is maintainer only)
     +1: danielsh (err->file and err->line are only in maintainer builds.
                   this is about err->message which is valid in all builds)
     -1: stsp (not a bug fix, changes output in a patch release)
