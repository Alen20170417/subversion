    Upgrade SWIG bindings to be compatible with SWIG 1.3.26-1.3.28

  * r18114, r18681
    In mailer.py:
    Fix bug: named substitutions gathered from defaults.for_repos were being
    ignored for sections which contained a specific for_repos option (r18114),
    and for fallback invocations of the [defaults] section (r18681).
    Justification:
      This can enable extensive simplification of configurations which want
      to put the repository name into the *_subject_prefix options.

  * r18504, r18509
    Add svnauthz-validate tool.
    Justification:
      Useful tool, low impact.
    Notes:
      Take diff to build.conf from r18509 then copy all of tools/server-side
      from r18509, it's all that's in that directory.

      +1: rooneg, dlr

  * r18924, r17931, r18928, r18951, r18953
    Support SWIG 1.3.28.
    Justification:
      The latest stable SWIG version is 1.3.28. To be used extensively,
      the Ruby bindings should support SWIG 1.3.28.

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      Windows, behavior which is inconsistent with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

  * r19319
    Add Content-Transfer-Encoding header to mails sent out by mailer.py.

      from munging incoming commit emails containing non-ASCII chararacters.
