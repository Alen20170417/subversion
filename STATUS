Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r19528
    Plug memleak with svn ls and mod_dav_svn.
    Justification:
      Listing large directories consumes large amounts of memory.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad

  * r19535, r19536
    Plug memleak in switch --relocate.
    Justification:
      Annoying if you relocate large trees.
    Notes:
      r19536 reverts a part that should never have been committed.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, dlr

  * r19538
    Reduce memory used by WC access batons, especially when upgrading WC
    format.
    Justification:
      Upgrading large WCs for 1.4 would require people to actually buy new
      memory...
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, dlr

  * r19543
    Fix the convert bug which is caused when converted target is NULL.
    Justification:
      The convert bug raises unnecessary exceptions.
    Votes:
      +1: kou
      +0: nori

  * r19558
    Return SVN_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE from svn_client_blame3() when
    WORKING is passed as the start or end revision.
    Justification:
      Avoids unexpected and undocumented behavior where WORKING is
      silently converted to BASE by svn_client__get_revision_number().
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, lundblad
      +0: nori

  * r19581, r19584
    Add peg rev help text for the 'info' and 'log' commands.
    Justification:
      Advertise that these commands actually support peg revs!
