This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.0:

Release blockers for 1.9.0:
===========================

 * r1678571
   Fix false-positive acceptance of certificates with multiple failures of
   which some but not all were designated acceptable.
   Justification:
     Security issue.
   Notes:
     The issue does not exist in 1.8.x or earlier.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh (not tested)

Candidate changes that cannot go into a later 1.9.x:
====================================================

 * r1674301, r1674305, r1674308, r1674339, r1674340, r1674475
   --config-option: Warn when the FILE:SECTION:OPTION combination may be
   invalid.
   Justification:
     Silently accepting invalid input is bad.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben (1.9.0 only)
         (Last minute change. Patch tested & Ok
          Not a problem if it only gets released in 1.10.0)
     -0.5: rhuijben (after 1.9.0. Changes error behaviour. Might break scripts)

 * r1677440
   Support checksum (de-)serialization for all 1.9 checksum types.
   Justification:
     Public API must have a complete implementation.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +1: rhuijben (1.9.0 only. Should be private api for >=1.9.1)

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674455, r1674456
   Make 'svn cp ^/A/D/H@1 ^/A' properly create A
   Justification:
     Resurrecting a child as its own ancestor should work, instead of produce
     an error message on a non existing problem.
   Notes:
     Not a regression. Same issue exists in 1.7.x and 1.8.x
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1675774
   Use the /usr/libexec/java_home program to find the JDK on OSX.
   Justification:
     Without this change, we'll tend to find original 1.6 JDK on newer
     versions of OSX instead of the latest and/or default.
   Notes:
     Soak restart is not needed after this fix, IMO.
   Votes:
     +1: brane
     +0: rhuijben (Unable to test)

 * r1677003
   Bump reqired Java version to 1.6 for JavaHL.
   Justification:
     Java 5 is dead. JavaHL 1.9+ uses 1.6 APIs.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, rhuijben

 * r1678147, r1678149, r1678151
   Provide more informative error messages for FSFS parsing errors.
   Justification:
     "Serialized hash missing terminator" is a mostly useless error message.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1678494
   Document svn:auto-props.
   Justification:
     Documentation should be complete.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
