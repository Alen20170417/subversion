Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)

 * r1705038
   Fix issue 4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1724448
   Fix handling of newly secured subdirectories in a working copy
   Justification:
     Regression against <= 1.6.x. Without this patch a directory that
     (still) exists locally but to which a user has no access is handled as
     a local obstruction on the next update that brings a change to this tree
     and the local working copy state is broken. This patch handles the
     incoming change as a delete, properly marking a tree conflict if
     necessary, allowing a user to make a copy of local changes.
     (Committing a copy would be hard though... as the user most likely
      doesn't have the rights to copy from what is now hidden).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp

 * r1734106
   Fix a bug where the wrong source left revision was recorded in a tree
   conflict.
   Justification:
     Conflict info recorded in WC should be correct.
     Fix will help users who upgrade to 1.10 with conflicts recorded in WC.
     Also, merging this allows r1760570 to merge cleanly.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1761334
   Fix issue #4653: SVN_LOCALE_DIR incorrectly interpolated when
   prefix is not set explicitly.
   Justification:
     ./configure with no arguments should just work.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stsp
     +0: rhuijben (patch looks safe, but not sure enough for +1)

 * r1762338, r1762339, r1769973
   Fix issue #4655: add zlib discovery through pkg-config.
   Justification:
     Allows building Subversion with non-default zlib layouts, such as
     with libraries in $zlib_prefix/lib/hpux32 on HP-UX.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +1: kotkov (without r1769973)
     +0: rhuijben (patch looks good. Untested) (+1 for r1769973)

 * r1759117, r1759122, r1759123, r1759124, 1764676
   Fix issue #4657: "Offset too large" error when packing repository in
   FSFS 7 format.
   Justification:
     Problem occurred in at least two user repositories.  Without the fix,
     format 7 repositories with an exceptionally large number of changes in
     a pack cannot be packed - which renders using f7 pointless for those
     users.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-fsfs-pack-fixes@r1764683
   Notes:
     r1759117-23 provide the actual fixes.
     r1759124 adds a regression test with the necessary internal API changes.
     r1764676 eliminates our reliance on the currently broken APR trunc().
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +1: stsp (There is a no-op whitespace change in the file
               subversion/tests/libsvn_subr/io-test.c -- would be
               nice to get rid of that before merging the branch)

 * r1766699, r1766704, r1766711
   Fix a bug where reintegrate merges access a non-existent path and error out.
   Justification:
     This problem can prevent reintegration of branches in some situations.
     Advanced users can fall back to a 2-URL merge but most users won't
     realize how they can work around the problem.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +0: rhuijben

 * r1769152
   Make hook script environments actually work with svnserve.
   Justification:
     svnserve should enable this feature just like mov_dav_svn and ra_local do.
     User complained.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1760570
   Fix a spurious 'incoming edit' tree conflict with an unmodified file.
   Justification:
     Tree conflicts should not be raised unnecessarily.
   Notes:
     Depends on r1734106 to be merged first to avoid a text conflict
     in the test suite code.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, stefan2, rhuijben

* r1769456
  Fix issue #4660: svn info --show-item=revision contains trailing whitespaces.
  Justification:
    Having trailing whitespaces in the output complicates the usage in scripts
    which is one of the main purposes of the new --show-item option.
  Votes:
    +1 (non-binding): luke1410
    +1: rhuijben, danielsh (via IRC), stsp

 * r1766352, r1766590
   Fix issue #4658: Can't reconstruct fulltext from DELTA against PLAIN in FSFS
   Justification:
     Prevents access to committed data.  This is as close to a corruption one
     could get without actually corrupting anything.  User reported issue.
   Notes:
     r1766352 contains the actual fix.
     r1766590 adds a test case for it.
     The merge conflicts if a trunk client is used!
