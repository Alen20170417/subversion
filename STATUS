This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.0.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.0.1:
================

1.0.1 is currently scheduled for Tuesday, 9 March 2004.  A thought: it
would be nice if all changes could be *committed* by the beginning of
Friday, March 5th (er, UTC), so we have a period in which there's
something stable to test.

Candidate changes:

  * r8431
    Bugfix to commits: allow deletions below schedule-add-with-history dirs.
    Justification:  reported by a user, an unnecessary restriction.
    Notes:  change just sets a flag differently for this case.  See #830.

      +1: sussman
      -1: cmpilato (this change is a fix followup to r8490, which is not
                    going to live in 1.0.x line since it changes an API)
