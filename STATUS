This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1480080, r1481772, r1481847
   Instruct clang to not warn about unknown warning flags.
   Justification:
     Newer versions of clang accept warning flags that they do not
     support, but emit warnings about them instead -- making the
     compile output a mess with a warning emitted for every
     single C and C++ file in an optimized build (because
     of the -Wno-clobbered, see above).
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     +1: danielsh
     +0: rhuijben (looks ok, but I can't test or verify via code inspection)

 * r1477876, r1477891, r1478001, r1479605
   Fix a bug whereby a property conflict description always reported
     'unknown' for the node kind. Add a test which catches that bug.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1477876
   Notes:
     The fix is in r1477876, and the branch was needed to resolve conflicts
     (rather than porting prior changes on which it depended). The test is
     in r1478001, and it depends on the test file changes made in r1477891.
     r1479605 fixes an interactive conflict resolution bug triggered by this
     change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, stsp

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)
     -0: rhuijben, breser (merge conflict in configure.ac in r1481848
                           <danielsh> resolved on the branch)

 * r1483575, r1483580, r1485018
   Define SVN_UNALIGNED_ACCESS_IS_OK for PowerPC.
   Justification:
     Performance for free.
   Votes:
     +1: mattiase (non-binding, not including r1485018)
     +1: breser, stefan2

 * r1485127
   Revert 1.8 behavior change that breaks some url forms when passed to
   ra_local. Without this some existing working copies using non standard
   urls to access the repository might be broken.
   Justification:
     Restores functionality that was lost in 1.8 compared to 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (for 1.8.1 or soak restart), danielsh

 * r1479540
   Add an in typemap for PROPHASH to the Perl bindings.
   Justification:
     Make it easier to use APIs that take hashes of properties as input.
   Votes:
     +1: breser

 * r1479563, r1480119, r1487083
   Make svn_client_log5() callable from the Perl bindings.
   Justification:
     1.6 API that wasn't wrapped yet.
   Votes:
     +1: breser
