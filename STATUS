Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12273
    Fix simple bug in 'svn ls "local file with space(s) in its name"'.
    Justification: Trivial change, annoying bug.
    Votes:
      +1: kfogel

  * r12278 (Issue #2159)
    Better log region max size in default DB_CONFIG.

      +1: kfogel, jerenkrantz

  * r12075
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.

  * r11483, r12072, r12157, r12158, r12180 (Issue #2091)
    Unitialized variable on Win98.
    Justification:
      It was causing random failures for our Win98 users.  The fix
      also correctly sets the locale path now, making locale stuff
      work as well.
    Notes: Change looks good to me.  I can't in good conscience +1
      it only because I don't have the environment to test nor the
      docs to review the MultiByteToWideChar() call.  -kfogel

      Sorry for all the revs, but I got some excellent feedback
      from Max Bowsher and others.  The extra revs incorporate
      all of that.  -jszakmeister

      +0: kfogel, lundblad

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

  * r12006, r12136, r12146
    Fix issue 2124 - bugs in svn switch over ra-dav.
    Justification:
      Changes made in the 1.1 client cause 1.0 and 1.1 servers to be
      driven in a way that weren't able to handle, resulting in
      working copies that *look* okay, but can actually send commits
      to the wrong repository location (if able to commit at all).
      r12006: Teach mod_dav_svn how to handle the new request.
      r12136: Make sure there is a versioned entry before setting the property.
      r12146: Work around for buggy 1.1.0/1.1.1 servers by disabling res. walk.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel, jerenkrantz

  * r12063, r12084 (Issue #2119)
    Canonicalize paths received over the wire in ra_svn and svnserve.
    Justification:
      Protects against API violations, which lead to assertion failures.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, epg

  * r12100, r12111, r12114
    Fix output of notifications when merging a deletion of a directory.
    Justification:
      It just looks ugly and sloppy.
    Branch: 1.1.x-r12100
    Votes:
      +1: breser, kfogel

  * r12117
    Fix merges that replace directories.
    Justification:
      Without this fix it is impossible to merge some sets of revisions in one
      step.
    Branch: 1.1.x-r12117
    Votes:
      +1: breser, kfogel

 * r12184
   Fix crash in javahl binding, when trying to retrieve non-existing property
   Justification:
     2 simple fixes in javahl binding only to prevent crash of jvm. Reported
     by users.
   Votes:
      +1: pmayweg, jerenkrantz

 * r11871
   Support BDB 4.3.
   Justification:
     System will startup with BDB 4.3, but die at run-time without this.
   Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r12102
    Fix a slight ABI/API incompatability between 1.0.x and 1.1.x
    Justification:
      If we treat the Apache modules as just another client then e broke our
      compatability rules.  This fixes it and makes the Debian folks happy
      who have an open bug on the issue.  See:
