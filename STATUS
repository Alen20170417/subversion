Candidate changes for 1.5.1:
============================

 * r30632, r30749, r30750, r31757, r31769, r31817
   Fix issue #3174, 'Merge algorithm chokes on subtrees needing special
   attention that have been renamed'.
   Justification:
     File merges that encounter this problem break, the fix is fairly simple,
     and directory merges already have the equivalent fix in 1.5.0.
   Notes:
     r31817 is the core fix for the issue, the other revision relate to
     a new test and some subsequent tweaks for to it.  Note that r31769 is
     nominated in the issue #3067 group too as it touches both issues.
     There are several minor conflicts when backporting this group to 1.5.x.
     To facilitate review a backport branch was created at
     http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.5.x-issue3174.

     +0: markphip (ran all tests, including all bindings and serf)


 * r31658, r31659
   Fix a remaining bug with issue #2825, Handle --depth option for 'merge'
   operations in terms of both content and mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     An inoperative merge to a directory at --depth files should set
     non-inheritable mergeinfo on the merge target and 'normal' mergeinfo
     on any of the target's file children.  Without this fix the file
     children get no mergeinfo set/updated.  This is a fairly minor bug, but
     it is inconsistent with the way we currently handle inoperative merges
     in every other situation (i.e. we still set mergeinfo - see issue #2883).
   Notes:
     kfogel reviewed this and had a question, posted in:
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=141286

 * r32236
   This should have been part of #3220 & #3235 group, just got missed.
   Lack of this revision causes 'log_tests.py' and 'blame_tests-10' to fail.

=================


 * r31313
   Make all ra layers return a consistent error when a path is not
   found in the repository.
   Notes:
     Small change, but API consistency is always a good thing.
     Does not merge cleanly!
   Question:
     Does r32056, nominated below, fix these test failures?
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, cmpilato, jerenkrantz
     +0: arfrever (serf tests fail)
     -0: markphip (serf tests fail on OSX), epg (failure confirmed)
