This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1480080, r1481772, r1481847
   Instruct clang to not warn about unknown warning flags.
   Justification:
     Newer versions of clang accept warning flags that they do not
     support, but emit warnings about them instead -- making the
     compile output a mess with a warning emitted for every
     single C and C++ file in an optimized build (because
     of the -Wno-clobbered, see above).
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     +1: danielsh
     +0: rhuijben (looks ok, but I can't test or verify via code inspection)

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)
     -0: rhuijben, breser (merge conflict in configure.ac in r1481848
                           <danielsh> resolved on the branch)

 * r1488183
   Check target WC for mixed revisions, local modifications and switched
   subtrees before contacting server for merge calculations.
   Justification:
     Merge calculations can easy take 10 seconds over WAN, while mixed
     revisions working copy are common. Small fix.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan

 * r1488294
   Add signal information to external program errors.
   Justification:
     Makes it easier to diagnose failures.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, danielsh

 * r1488425
   Fix issue 4369, poor serf error message for commit with stolen locks.
   Justification:
     Confusing to user and a regression from 1.7/neon.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     +0: danielsh

 * r1489114, r1489116
   Require Serf 1.2.1.
   Justification:
     Serf 1.2.0 doesn't work where Digest authentication is in use.
     See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4371 and
     https://code.google.com/p/serf/issues/detail?id=102 for details.
   Notes:
     This is a blocking issue.
