This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.0:

Release blockers for 1.9.0:
===========================

Candidate changes that cannot go into a later 1.9.x:
====================================================

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan
     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

 * 1686175, r1687029
   Fix issue #4285, "reintegrate complains about missing ranges from node
   unrelated to branch"
   Justification:
     Reintegrate merge is impossible after the default conflict resolution
     option is applied to a particular tree conflict during a sync merge.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1684940, r1685034, r1687769, r1687776
   Make 'svnadmin verify --keep-going --quiet' print error details to stderr,
   as documented by 'svnadmin help verify'.
   Justification:
     Calling a command with --quiet should not hide important parts of the
     output, such as verification errors.  Without this fix, 'svnadmin verify
     --keep-going --quiet' is rather useless in terms that it only gives an
     indication of whether a particular repository passes the verification or
     not, but doesn't show the root cause (error details) of what's wrong.
   Notes:
     This change features a redesign of the error reporting scheme being used
     by svn_repos_verify_fs3() API.  At some point we realized that the way
     API was working previously forced us to write rather hacky code on the
     calling side in order to achieve the wanted behavior.  With the API
     redesign, this is no longer needed.  Full discussion can be found in
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-05/0141.shtml (Subject: "Possible
     incompatibility of svn_repos_verify_fs2() in 1.9.0-rc1").
     .
     r1684940 and r1685034 contain the initial fix for this problem and the
     test.  r1687769 is the core fix that changes svn_repos_verify_fs3() API
     and supersedes the fix from r1684940.  r1687776 is a documentation-only
     follow-up to r1687769.  This is a 1.9.0 blocker due to a change in the
     unreleased API.

     +1: kotkov, rhuijben, brane

 * r1688273, r1688395
   Implement the new semantics of the changed svn_repos_verify_fs3 in JavaHL.
   Justification:
     This is a follow-up to the changed in the r1684940 group which is
     already approved for backport, and a bindings API change that
     can't be backported after 1.9.0.
   Notes:
     r1688273 implements the API semantics; r1688395 contains
     minor spelling and documentation fixes.
     .
     Clean merge depends on merging the r1684940 group first.
