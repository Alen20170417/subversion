This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r30510
    Fixes a minor bug When filtering self-referential mergeinfo from incoming
    property additions during a merge:  If the incoming property addition
    was simply empty mergeinfo, then that property got discarded.  No
    practical effect on the ultimate mergeinfo set by the merge, but the merge
    notifications were incorrect.  See
    http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=137120.
    Notes:
      This replaces r30503, which claimed to do the same thing, and it did.
      Sadly it did other things too.  Bad things.  Things which got it
      reverted in r30509.

  * r30439, r30441, r30442, r30443, r30466, r30469, r30470, r30471,
     r30472, r30473
    Make the test suite in server-minor-version=4 mode pass
    against 1.4.x servers.
    Notes:
      r30443 conflicts trying to modify an svnadmin test which isn't in
      1.5.x; the proper resolution is to delete the whole conflict block
      from <<< to >>> (which looks like the addition of
      fsfs_recover_handle_missing_revs_or_revprops_file).
    How to test:
      1.5.x-checkout$ svnserve-1.4.x -d -r `pwd`/subversion/tests/cmdline &
      1.5.x-checkout$ make svncheck SERVER_MINOR_VERSION=4

  * r30517, r30518, r30523
    Improve dav-svn operational logging and compat with svnserve logging.
    Notes:
      Revert on trunk if these don't make it into 1.5.0.
      Probably easiest to handle these three blocks at once (tested):
        merge -c 30474 -r30515:30523
