Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)

 * r1704292, r1704573
   Make svn diff --git produce proper forward binary diffs
   Justification:
     Applying accidental reverse diffs might work for git, but isn't
     going to work for our 1.10 'svn patch' implementation.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1710167
   Set journal-mode in exclusive-locking mode to improve NFS performance.
   Justification:
     Reduces performance regression compared to 1.8.

     +1: philip, stefan2

 * r1668625
   Fix 'svn diff --summarize --ignore-properties'.
   Justification:
     --ignore-properties option should not be ignored in summarize diff mode.
   Notes:
     Doesn't change APIs. Just 'svn'.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1717876, r1717877
   Fix svn_fs_contents_different on FSFS producing false negatives.
   Justification:
     Under rare circumstances, see issue #4554, the API may not recognize
     two file contents as being different.  This may result in incomplete
     reports and dump files.
   Notes:
     r1717877 provides a test case that verifies everything still works
     even with the EXPANDED_SIZE check removed.

 * r1705038
   Fix issue 4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1717874, r1717875, r1717878
   Make inherited property api consistent over all ra layers
   Justification:
     Our ra implementations should follow the documentation... and should
     be as consistent as possible between each other. Only because the
     caller uses svn_path_url_add_component2() this wasn't noticed by
     our code.

 * r1663500
   Fix issue #4557, "ra_serf fails to delete directory containing many files"
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.8.10.
   Notes:
     The associated test is still failing because it was extended to check
     COPY as well as DELETE. Issue #4557 is just about DELETE requests.  
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1721174
   hot-backup.py: Housekeeping.
   Justification:
     Do the right thing on repository names that contain '+' or '('.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1721175
   hot-backup.py: Input validation.
   Justification:
     Better failure mode on --archive-type=foobar typos.

 * r1720643
   Ignore absent nodes during javahl version of svn status -u
   Justification:
