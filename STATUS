Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.

  * r14280
    Build ZLib from sources on Windows.
    Justification:
      Cures major PITA for Windows developers, improves debugging support.
    Concerns:
      Not exactly a showstopper for 1.2.0.
    Votes:
      +0.9: brane (+1 for 1.2.1)

  * r14286
    Make "make davautocheck" work for locking and work out-of-the-box
    on more systems.
    Justification:
      Makes it easier to test over DAV; not a core code change.

  * r14046, r14070, r14301
    Improvements in the testing framework
    Justification:
      Low impact; r14046 and r14070 should've been on the 1.2.x branch
      from day one. r14301 speeds up testing on Windows, where three
      tests run in parallel take hardly any more time than a single test.
      Not a core code change.
    Votes:
      +1: brane, fitz (concept [no win32 setup])

  * r14414 - r14417, r14429
    Rename wbel-3 to rhel-3, add rhel-4, add detecion
    of more platforms (now detects CentOS, RHEL, and WBEL), fix name of
    patch file.
    Justification: Builds "out-of-the-box" now on more platforms.

    Re-enable BDB portion of build for RHEL4 as it has good BDB 4.2.52.

  * r14454
    JavaHL status not returning correct date for Lock Creation Date.
    Justification:
      A simple 1-line fix.
    Notes:

      +1: pmayweg, dlr

  * r14482
    mod_dav_svn locking bugfix:  don't let creation/expiration dates overflow.
    Justification:  a negative date causes svn_time_from_cstring to error
                    when reading back lock from filesystem.  Very simple fix.
