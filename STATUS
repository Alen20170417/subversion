Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20701, r20703
    Add 'neon' dependencies to svnsync, ra-local-test, and svn-push,
    working around libtool bug.
    Justification:
      Needed to successfully run tests if compiling against an installed Neon,
      and there are old Subversion libraries in the same directory as Neon.
    Branch:
      rs=http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
      svn merge -r20702:HEAD $rs/branches/1.4.x-r20701
      # In case of svnmerge-integrated property conflict (inevitable unless
      # nothing else has been merged since the merge branch was created),
      # revert just the svnmerge-integrated property:
      svn ps svnmerge-integrated `svn pg -rbase svnmerge-integrated` .
      svn resolved .
      # and re-record the merge:
      svnmerge merge -M -F -r 20701,20703

  * r20729
    Pay attention to any errors caused by manipulating hook script
    (write) file handles.
    Justification:
      Fixes error handling for hooks.
    Note:
      Something of an edge case; definitely not a blocker for 1.4.0.
