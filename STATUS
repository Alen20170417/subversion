This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * 1.8.x-svn_fs_info-removal
   Remove an API that is #define'd away and not compiled, as well as
   fs-loader.h parts of it.
   Justification:
     Deleting dead code.  Will be released in 1.9x.
   Branch: 1.8.x-svn_fs_info-removal
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, stsp

 * r1467440, r1467450, r1467481
   Unclutter maintainer-mode stack traces.
   Justification:
     Code was in flux when the branch was cut.  Maintainer sanity.
   Votes:
     -1: stsp (as stated on dev@, I'd rather have 1.8 use 1.7-style
               error reporting -- let's settle on a new style for 1.9)
     +1: danielsh (stsp: this only changes maintainer mode output;
                   there is no user-visible change)

 * r1467587
   Fix issue #3913, "svnrdump load" is not working in interactive mode
   Justification:
     Fixes a UI quirk requiring users to remember typing --force-interactive
     for auth creds prompting to work, in a situation where we should
     be prompting for creds by default IMHO.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1467597
   Better error message if authentication fails and -F - was used.
   Justification:
     Nice-to-have usability fix. Explains a side-effect of the new-in-1.8
     interactive prompting default behaviour which could be considered a
     regression from 1.7 (use case now requires --force-interactive).
