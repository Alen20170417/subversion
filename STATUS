Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14024
    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.
    Justification:
      Encourages hacking on the bindings, and improves user confidence.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, fitz (concept)

  * r14280
    Build ZLib from sources on Windows.
    Justification:
      Cures major PITA for Windows developers, improves debugging support.
    Concerns:
      Not exactly a showstopper for 1.2.0.
    Votes:
      +0.9: brane (+1 for 1.2.1)

  * r14286
    Make "make davautocheck" work for locking and work out-of-the-box
    on more systems.
    Justification:
      Makes it easier to test over DAV; not a core code change.

  * r14046, r14070, r14301
    Improvements in the testing framework
    Justification:
      Low impact; r14046 and r14070 should've been on the 1.2.x branch
      from day one. r14301 speeds up testing on Windows, where three
      tests run in parallel take hardly any more time than a single test.
      Not a core code change.
    Votes:
      +1: brane

  * r14401
    Fix Issue #2224: 'svn cp mydir mydir' in a wc recurses infinitely.
    Justification:
      A simple 2-line fix.
    Notes:
      Not a showstopper for 1.2.0.

  * r14414 - r14417, r14429: Rename wbel-3 to rhel-3, add rhel-4, add detecion
    of more platforms (now detects CentOS, RHEL, and WBEL), fix name of
    patch file.
    Justification: Builds "out-of-the-box" now on more platforms.
