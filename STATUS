This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.


Status of 1.4.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21249, r21251, r21253, r21254
    Fix a bug in the svn_fs_closest_copy() implementations that caused
    confusing errors when tracing certain node locations.  See issue #2600.
    Notes:
      The bugfix is in r21254 -- all the others just add regression tests.

      +1: djh, dlr

  * r21357

  * r21384, r21047
    A merge which results in a conflicted file in your WC should
    produce a "conflicted" merge notification.  'svn merge --dry-run'
    needs to be smarter about accessing the working copy (see issue
    #2584).

  * r21392
    Fix the Python bindings tests so that they use URLs which work
    on Windows.

      +1: dionisos

  * r21473
    Fix compile error when APR_HAS_DSO is not defined (e.g. on RISC OS).
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r21483
    Improve error checking when running external commands (e.g. hook scripts).
    Justification:
      At the moment, unexpected errors encountered while checking a
      process's exit status result in assigning it a random exit status.

  * r21526
    Pass path, not url, in to ne_lock_discover.
    Justification:
      Neon wants the path, it's only by chance that the URL usually works.

  * r21531
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.

  * r21609
    Make it possible to check out repositories with spaces in ther names over
    ra_svn.

      Simple fix.  User reported problem.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, dlr

  * r21638, r21566, r21641
    Fix issue #2533, making 'svn status -u' show remotely changed
    properties on the root of a working copy.
    Justification:
      A user reported bug with a straightforward fix, plus regression
      test.

Approved changes:

  * r21575
    Update the URL for the svnmerge.py wiki page.
    Justification:
      Bad to send out old URLs.  Documentation only commit.

      +1: blair, dlr

  * r21592
    Add the -l or --log command line option in svn_all_diffs.pl's
    usage message.
    Justification:
      Without a usage message documenting it, people won't know it's
      there unless they browse the source code.
