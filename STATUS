Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r11483 (Issue #2091)
    Unitialized variable on Win98.
    Justification:
      It was causing random failures for our Win98 users.  The fix
      also correctly sets the locale path now, making locale stuff
      work as well.
    Notes: Change looks good to me.  I can't in good conscience +1
      it only because I don't have the environment to test nor the
      docs to review the MultiByteToWideChar() call.  -kfogel

  * r11527
    Fix blame calculation algorithm.
    Justification:
      Correctness issue.

  * r11215, r11264
    SVN has needed a good packaging script for Win32 since forever.
    Justification:
      This and the related build and test script changes will make
      creating 1.1.x Win32 binary packages a lot easier.
    Note: This depends on other changes not mentioned above; I'll
      develop the patch on branches/1.1.x-build.

  * r11557
    Fix #1905. URI-encode path in copyfrom URL in merge.
    Justification:
      Nasty bug with simple fix.
    Notes: Looks sensible but doesn't have a regression test.  I'm too
      lazy to test manually, how can I be sure it works?  -philip

  * r11439, r11669
    Fix slow "svn st" where the targets are files by not locking the whole

      +1: lundblad
      (r11439 nominated by): Steve King

  * r11665
    Make FSFS commits work with insert-only perms on db/revs.
    Justification:
      This is a pretty straightforward order-of-operations change, is
      how I (Greg) always intended FSFS to work, and fulfills what has
      been a secondary goal of FSFS from the beginning.

    Justification:
