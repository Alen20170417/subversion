Candidate changes:
==================

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1823989
   Correct the generated fsfs.conf file's statement of the default value of
   verify-before-commit.  It is keyed not on --enable-debug but on
   --enable-maintainer-mode (on Windows there is no distinction between the
   two).
   Justification:
     Don't mislead users into wrongly believing verification is enabled.

 * r1823966
   Shelving: fix unsafe 'system' calls.
   Justification:
     Avoids potential command-line-quoting-safety issues.
