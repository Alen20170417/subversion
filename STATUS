This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10604
    Cleanup some qsort-related stuff.
    Justification:
      Removes *4* redundant functions, but adds a new API.
    Notes:
      The docstring for svn_sort_compare_paths says "New in 1.1."
      and needs to be updated to say 1.2 if this does not go in.
    Votes:
      -0: ghudson, lundblad (what's the point of putting code cleanups into
          1.1?)
      +1: cmpilato

  * r10775
    Wrap svn_config_enumerator_t for Perl bindings.
    Justification:
      Perl bindings only; completeness.
    Votes:
      +1: clkao

  * r10800 (Issue #2031)
    Add -lstdc++ to javahl binding DSO at link-time.
    Justification:
      The javahl shared library does not link correctly on certain platforms.
      (This is really a libtool bug.)

  * r10819, r10855
    Avoid repository corruption if executed with closed std{in,out,err}
    Justification:
      Simple fix for a nasty problem that has bitten at least one user.
    Votes:
       +1: bliss, maxb
       +1 (r10819 only, so far): ghudson
       -1: brane [until someone explains to me why this should be a
                  Unix-only change]

  * r10772, r10858
    Allow 'svn commit' to delete schedule-delete symlinks. (issue 2045)
    Justification:
      Trivial fix to a new svn 1.1 feature.
    Votes:
      +1: sussman, jpieper

  * r10676
    Fix segfault when committing renamed-file with changed svn:eol-style prop.
    Justification:
        Segfaults are bad.  One-line fix to prevent deref'ing NULL.
    Votes:
      +1: sussman, jpieper
      +0: (philip?  sussman is guessing here)
