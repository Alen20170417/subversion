delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.19:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1438879
   Make 'show-diff' at the interactive conflict prompt show nicer diffs.
   Justification:
     'show-diff' produces unreadable diffs in some cases, especially with
     conflicts recorded during merges.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1438879
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +0: rhuijben (Shouldn't we provide a three way diff instead of guessing
                   a base to show a one way diff against based on the
                   operation?
                   
                   I would prefer to have show-diff always work against
                   the local pristine version, instead of sometimes against
                   their or their-old (src-left) version, as that is the final
                   change I would commit.)

 * r1461760
   Additional fix related to issue #4340, "filenames containing \n corrupt
   FSFS repositories"
   Justification:
     This change makes libsvn_repos block filenames containing control
     characters. Control characters in filenames have always been rejected
     by libsvn_client, but client-side software bypassing libsvn_client
     could still commit such filenames. Control characters in filenames
     can cause problems not just in FSFS but also in dump files, unidiff,
     and possibly elsewhere. It is a good idea to make the client and
     server consistent.
     See discussion linked from issue #4340 for more information.

     +1: stsp
     -0: danielsh (restrictions not suitable for introduction in patch release;
                   dev@ thread started 2013/05/10 9pm)

 * r1542765, r1571214
   Add Sqlite index information.
   Justification:
     Adding this information explains to Sqlite how we use our indexes. While
     Subversion 1.7 doesn't depend on this as much as 1.8 as we didn't tune the
     queries as much at that time, this information will make several queries
     use indexes instead of table scans.

     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1542765

     +1: rhuijben

 * r1643074
   Don't let invalid mergeinfo stop 'svnadmin load' from working.
     Part of issue #4476 "Mergeinfo containing r0 makes svnsync and svnadmin
     dump fail".
   Justification:
     The presence of 'bad' metadata in a repository should not prevent
     backing up and restoring from a backup, given that this data does not
     make the repository totally unusable.
   Notes:
     The 'svnadmin dump' part of this issue is already approved for backport.
     The 'svnsync' part of this issue is not yet fixed.

 * r1640862, r1640873, r1643793
   Work with libtool 2.4.3
   Justification:
     libtool 2.4.3 is needed to build properly on OS X 10.10
   Votes:
     +1: breser (without r1643793)
     +1: philip, brane

 * r1643810
   Avoid unneeded memory growth in mod_dav resource walking (issue 4531)
   Justification:
     Some copy operations failed in certain user scenarios, with really huge
     trees.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1409804
   Add a delimiter between the two chains in svn_error_compose_create().
   Justification:
     Allow users to tell where the second error chain starts -- avoids
     misrepresentation that the first error is caused by the second.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (I'm not sure if this should be in a patch release and the
                   stacktrace where this refers to is maintainer only)
     +1: danielsh (err->file and err->line are only in maintainer builds.
                   this is about err->message which is valid in all builds)
     -1: stsp (not a bug fix, changes output in a patch release)

Approved changes:
