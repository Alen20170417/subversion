Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or

   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)

 * r1700215, r1700219, r1700220, r1701270
   Fix argument passing in test suite.
   Justification:
     Makes svnfsfs_tests.py work in fsfs-v4 and fsfs-v6 modes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1700215
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Log level on standard invocation of win-tests.py changes)

 * r1701598, r1701603, r1701611, r1701646
   Make 'svn lock' and 'svn unlock' report (un)lock errors as failure
   Justification:
     A single lock or unlock failure doesn't affect the whole operation
     since 1.9, but this has the side effect of no longer producing an
     error at all on failures. This patch makes 'svn' return an error when
     at least one failure is reported by the locking code.
   Notes:
     r1701598 is the actual fix. The other patches simplify and fix
     test expectations.
   Votes:
     +0.9: rhuijben (Minor behavior change. Needs more dev@ discussion)

 * r1702533
   Expose utf8proc version information via 'svn --version --verbose'
   Justification:
     There is no way to retrieve this from the binaries.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan
     +0: stefan2 (the new private API function needs a docstring,
                  +1 otherwise)

 * r1702974, r1702991
   Improve error reporting on certain specific database corruptions.
   Justification:
     BH: Although I really don't like adding code for these insane corner
     cases that should not be triggerable without memory or disk corruptions
     the number of exception reports from TortoiseSVN (Thousands!) requests
     some action to help investigating.
     I'm surprised that we didn't get a single report from any of our other
     clients though.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1698312, r1702310
   Correctly report empty representations in 'svnfsfs stats'.
   Justification:
     The current code displays the "0" bracket in histograms as
     "-2147483648 .. < 1" instead of "0 .. < 1".  Technically correct
     but annoying.  UI change only.
