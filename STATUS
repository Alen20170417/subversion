This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30129
   Fix a bug that Svn::Ra::Session#open doesn't set callback_baton correctly.
   Votes:
     +1: kou

 * r30215, r30221, r30225, r30226, r30230, r30243
   Simplify (UI-wise) yet vastly enhance the 'svn mergeinfo' subcommand and
   underlying APIs.
   Backport Branch:
     /branches/1.5.x-r30215
   Notes:
     If we approve this, we'll want to merge r30238 from the
     1.5.x-r30215 branch to trunk (to purge the APIs that never made
     it into 1.5).
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r30210
   Call abort_edit upon editor failure in the repos reporter.
   Notes:
     This bug has always been here; no need to hold the release for it.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r30233
   Don't conditionalize the SASL section of the autogenerated svnserve.conf
   on build-time availability.
   Votes:
     +1: glasser

 * r30161
   Fix bug in copy-on-update/ra_neon which prevents updates of nodes copied
   with property deletion.
   Notes:
     Fixes serious regression, with a test.
     Somebody more familiar with our WebDAV protocol should audit that code
     and similar parts of serf/mod_dav_svn to make sure there aren't similar
     problems remaining (deleting or opening nodes in a copied directory,
     say, although current copy-on-update code doesn't send copied
     directories).

   subsequent merges.

   Ensure svn_mergeinfo_parse() returns always returns
   SVN_ERR_MERGEINFO_PARSE_ERROR as the topmost error in a chain as the API
   promises.

   Clarification of svn_rangelist_merge doc string noting that it compacts

   behavior.

   Corrections to the overview comment of the svn:mergeinfo property in
