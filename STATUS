  * r17910
    Fix the ability to link libsvn_swig_py on Solaris 10 when
    compiling with GCC 3.4.2.
    Justification:
      Allows successful builds of the Python bindings in a relatively
      common situation on Solaris via a minor tweak to our build
      machinery which restores its behavior from Subversion 1.2.3 and
      earlier.  The new behavior is required only for Cygwin, and this
      change makes that (conditionally) so.
