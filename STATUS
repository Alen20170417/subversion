Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since that is nominated
     separately.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * fs-progress branch
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1146131 group (1.7.x-fs-verify).
   Branch:
     fs-progress
   Justification:
     Provide feedback during 'svnadmin verify'.
     Avoid an API change in 1.8.
   Notes:
     If this proposal passes, the docstrings @since would have to be fixed
     in a new commit.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh

 * r1147882, r1149343, r1149371, r1149372, r1149377, r1149398
   Validate consumer-supplied tokens in libsvn_fs.  (This specifically applies
   to the output of pre-lock hook scripts.)
   Justification:
     Input validations are good; arbitrary lock tokens are bad, and can result
     in user-visible errors.
   Notes:
     r1147882 is reverted by r1149343.
     r1149343 reverts r1147882 and adds new code, which r1149371 rewrites.
     r1149371 is the change.
     r1149372 improves an error message.
     r1149377 is a typo fix.
     r1149398 fixes the bindings.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1148424
   Resolve issue 3963, 'svn update -r{R>HEAD}' hangs client over ra_svn.
   Justification:
     Subversion and svnserve shouldn't hang waiting for IO that will
     never come when a user passes a revision that hasn't been committed
     yet.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * 1.7.x-neon-default branch
   Make neon the default http library.
   Justification:
     Serf isn't ready, new code not enabled, no proposal to enable it.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -1: gstein (I see no explanation for why "serf is not ready")

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r1148083, r1148094
   Preload libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring and libsvn_auth_kwallet in locally built
   executables.
   Justification:
     Version mismatch errors would occur during trying to use locally built
     executables when a different version of Subversion was installed in /usr/lib.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, philip

 * r1148992
   Print error messages about failures of dynamic loading of libraries when
   SVN_DEBUG_DSO is defined instead of never.
   Justification:
     Suboptimal r1148374 was already backported in r1148488.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, philip
     -0: rhuijben (A library shouldn't just write things to stderr. This needs
                   proper error handling instead. And besides I doubt anyone is
                   going to use this define (No veto!))

 * r1149160
   Make serf report an error when performing 'svn log' on a non existing path
   aka issue #3937.
   Justifications:
     There should be no known regressions in the default http ra layer.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1149240
   Support APR 0.9.
   Justification:
     We still claim to support it.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1149401
   Fail early when attempting to build swig-pl after configuring --without-swig.
   Justification:
     Convert mysterious error messages to a clean early exit.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, arfrever

 * r1149539
   Resolve issue #3969: provide proper cancellation support in the network loops
   in ra_serf.
   Justifications:
     GUI clients can't rely on EINTR being returned when a user tries to cancel
     an operation, as no signal is raised.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
