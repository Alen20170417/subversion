This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r29677, r29679, r29680
    Fixes a bug where empty mergeinfo on a subtree of a merge target was
    ignored when determining if a reintegrate merge is allowed. r29679
    and r29680 are related test tweaks.
    Votes:
      +1: glasser (via dev mail)

  * r29739, r29769, r29770
    Bugfixes in svnmerge-migrate-history.py, preventing no-op commits
    and dealing with syntax differences between svnmerge info and Subversion
    mergeinfo.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato

  * r29763
    Allow -c to take a comma-delimited revision list, cleaning up the syntax
    for 'svn merge' a bit.

Approved changes:

  * r29642
    Make sure that "svnadmin upgrade" never leaves an FSFS repository in
    a broken state.
    Votes:
      +1: glasser (via dev mail), cmpilato

  * r29738, r29751
    Allow 'log -g' to work in reverse order, and with --stop-on-copy.
    Notes: While r29738 really isn't required (r29751 removes the line it
      adds), it eliminates textual conflicts when merging r29751.
