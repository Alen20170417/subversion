This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the the time
being applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are
not core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29107, r29085:
     Stop merge from adding mergeinfo from a target's own history.
   Notes:
     No real functional change in terms of what gets merged and what doesn't,
     but it does reduce redundant explicit mergeinfo in some common use cases.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba (r29085 only)

Approved changes:

 * r29101; recommended-but-not-required: r29098
   Protect against some unnecessary (and sometimes expensive) RA reparentings
   Notes:
     r29098 isn't required, but is a formatting tweak that touches a bunch of
     lines, some of which are also touched by r29101.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, pburba
