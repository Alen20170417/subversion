This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17401
    Do not generate dependencies for autogenerated SWIG code when we
    are in release mode.
    Justification:
      Prior to r17401, Subversion regenerated the SWIG files if 'make'
      determined that the SWIG files were out of date, based on their
      timestamps. Users should not have to worry about carefully
      preserving timestamps. Thanks to r17401, we now only generate
      SWIG files when users run ./autogen.sh outside of release mode.

Approved changes:

  * r17394
    Change ra_local "invalid host" test to SKIP under Cygwin,
    as Cygwin has UNC paths too.
    Justification:
      Test erroneously fails otherwise. Failing test == bad.

  * r17395
    Use the APR_BINARY flag on all calls to apr_file_open().
    Justification:
      Subversion never wants the OS or CRT to do EOL munging behind its back.
      I've been applying this to the official Cygwin binaries for some time.
