This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30643, r30653, r30785
   Update bash completion script.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, stylesen

 * r30883, r30888
   Fix issue #3187.  Fix reverse merges where merge target or subtree
   has non-inheritable revision ranges intersecting with the merged
   range.  Not a common use case, but completely broken without this
   fix.
   Notes:
     r30888 is just a revert of some accidental whitespace changes
     in r30883.  This group changes the svn_rangelist_intersect API.
     If this group isn't backported for 1.5.0 it needs to be
     reverted on trunk and svn_rangelist_intersect() revved.

 * r30746, r30747
   Fix a minor merge range notification header bug.
   Notes:
     r30747 is just cleanup of some cruft that snuck in with r30746,
     thus adhering to my "every commit should need a follow-up" ethos.

Candidate changes:

Approved changes (all releases):
================================

 * r30852
   Fix test backported in r30838 but not adjusted to still use 1.5
   test suite API.
   Branch:
     1.5.x-tests-pass
   Notes:
     If we roll another rc after rc4, it must include this backport.
     (The previous broken backport was not in rc4, though.)
