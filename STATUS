Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16793, r16798
    Correct and clarify doc strings related to the new WC/repository
    state APIs in svn_wc.h.
    Justification:
      The doc strings otherwise indicate the opposite of the actual
      behavior, and in one case, the wrong initialization value.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

   * r16781
     Fix invalid enum type assignments.
     Justification:
       Assignment was not only to the completely wrong enum type, but
       worse, the values for the elements do not even match!
     Votes:
       +1: dlr

   * r16806, r16807
     Convert automatic memory management code into pure Python, so as
     to ensure thread safety.
     Justification:
       Might prevent segfaults and deadlock in multi-threaded
       environments (unverified).
     Votes:
       +0: djames

   * r16808
     Eliminate unnecessary function definitions in Python bindings.
     Justification:
       Prevents warnings.
