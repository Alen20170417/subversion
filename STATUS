Status of 1.8.14:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser
     -0: julianfoad (test is missing from branch -- how do we know it works?)

 * r1654932, r1654933, r1654934, r1654937
   Fix issue #4554, "0 file length reported in FSFS".
   Justification:
     This causes 'svnadmin dump' to create corrupted output that fails to
     load and we provide no way to detect that problem other than loading
     the respective dump.  We also want to prevent further instances of
     that issue to be added to the repository.
   Notes:
     r1561419 has been removed from this change set and proposed for a
     separate backport because it is not a necessary part of the #4554 fix.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4554-v2
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +1: stefan2 (before -v2 branch)
     +0: danielsh (hard to review all potential causes of expanded_size==0 in
                   7*3*2 cases (1.1…1.8) × (file/dir/prop rep) × (plain/delta))

 * r1666965, r1667120
   Reduce 'the lag' of the first svn log results over mod_dav.
   Justification:
     A slow svn log makes users call Subversion slow. This fixes the
     perceived performance problem by no longer optimizing just for
     obtaining all the results fast, but also for obtaining the first
     result fast.
     .
     Just the perceived slowness of common svn log operations might
     make users switch to a DVCS or implement a client side cache,
     while this slowness is just a buffering to make the total set of
     results come in faster. But I don't think there are that many users
     that really wait for all results of
     .
     $ svn log -q ^/subversion/trunk
     .
     This currently takes > 10 seconds before the first result using
     the EU mirror for me. With --limit 1 (best comparison with post-patch)
     that would be 0.2 seconds.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip (After it has been approved for 1.9)
     -0.5: ivan (It's not security or bug fix. The change itself a little
                 bit controversial for me, so it's better to release it as
                 part of Subversion 1.9.0)

 * r1669955
   Reduce FSFS memory allocation in Apache with unbounded MaxFreeMem.
   Justification:
     A user reported that their worker processes ran OOM with Apache 2.2
     in default configuration when fulltext caching was enabled. Although
     people should set MaxFreeMem to something other than 0, we should
     play nice with out-of-the-box setups.
     The patch itself is relatively low-risk (changes initial buffer size).
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-memory-fragmentation
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1667228, r1667234, r1667691
   Fix conflict description for binary file conflicts.
   Justification:
     Conflict description API violates its own promises.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1667228
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1674455
   Make 'svn cp ^/A/D/H@1 ^/A' properly create A
   Justification:
     Resurrecting a child as its own ancestor should work, instead of produce
     an error message on a non existing problem.
   Notes:
     Not a regression. Same issue exists in 1.7.x
     Needs backport branch since the test framework changed on trunk
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1674455
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp

 * r1678494, r1680495, r1680495
   Document svn:auto-props.
   Justification:
     Documentation should be complete.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +1: stsp (without r1680705)

 * r1674522
   Skip the 'upgrade_tests.py 36: automatic SQLite ANALYZE' test on old python
   Justification:
     Our testsuite shouldn't fail just because python has an old sqlite
     version compiled in.
   Notes:
     This nomination is partially to just mark this problem as 'known issue'.
     This patch was already accepted for 1.9.x

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1658168
   Properly handle errors when parsing skel encoded HTTP requests in
   mod_dav_svn.
   Justification:
     Without this fix server reports 400 (Bad Request) HTTP status code
     instead of expected 413 (Request Entity Too Large) for large
     skel encoded requests.
