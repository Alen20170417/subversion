  * r11483 (Issue #2091)
    Unitialized variable on Win98.
    Justification:
      It was causing random failures for our Win98 users.  The fix
      also correctly sets the locale path now, making locale stuff
      work as well.

Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r11215, r11264
      SVN has needed a good packaging script for Win32 since forever.
    Justification:
      This and the related build and test script changes will make
      creating 1.1.x Win32 binary packages a lot easier.
    Note: This depends on other changes not mentioned above; I'll
      develop the patch on branches/1.1.x-build.
