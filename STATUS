This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30746, r30747
   Fix a minor merge range notification header bug.
   Notes:
     r30747 is just cleanup of some cruft that snuck in with r30746,
     thus adhering to my "every commit should need a follow-up" ethos.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, markphip

 * r30949, r30962
   Fix issue #3188.  Mergeinfo on switched targets/subtrees should elide
   to repos.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, markphip

 * r31025
   Fix the SVN_ERR_AUTHN_CREDS_NOT_SAVED message.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, danielsh

 * r31031
   Match svn_io_check_path's docstring to its implementation.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, arfrever

 * r31049
   s/lock-nodes/lock-tokens/ in a message.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r31055 (subversion/bindings/swig)
   Make svn_wc_diff_callbacks2_t work in Python (not a new interface,
   it was just broken for Python until r31055).
   Notes:
     'svn merge -c 31055 ^/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig
     subversion/bindings/swig' cleanly merges the Python change.

Approved changes (all releases):
================================

 * r31018
   Fix svn_ra_open3() doc string to say "@since 1.5" not "@since 1.6".
   Notes: This falls into hacking.html's no-vote-necessary category.
     Since I'm nominating it anyway, I'll record my vote, but I'm
     just filing it directly in the Approved section.
