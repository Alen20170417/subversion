This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.0.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.0.0:
================

Release 1.0.0 is already frozen; subversion-0.37.0.tar.gz is the
candidate tarball, and that code will become 1.0.0 on February 23rd,
2004, after four weeks of soak time.  If you find a bug that you think
is important enough to delay 1.0.0, please start a dev@ list thread
and mention the thread below.

Ben thinks that the following things should probably be forcibly
synchronized between the trunk and 1.0 lines, before we roll a 1.0 tarball:

     - all top-level capitalized files:  README, INSTALL, HACKING,
       COMMITTERS, etc.

     - www/ area

     - doc/ area, especially the book.

     - bash_completion

     - all the cvs2svn.py stuff.
