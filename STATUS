This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r18549:
    Prevent svn_load_dirs.pl from trying to import .svn or _svn
      directories, which can cause svn core dumps since it treads over
      the working copies' .svn files.  Ouch!
    Justification:
      Causing core dumps bad.  Importing files from .svn into
      Subversion also bad.

  * r18550:
    Educate svn_load_dirs.pl to support symlinks.
    Justification:
      Nice for people using svn_load_dirs.pl to automatically update
      checked in symlinks from vendor drops.

  * r17280, r18172, r18205, r18491
    Upgrade SWIG bindings to be compatible with SWIG 1.3.26-1.3.28

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      Windows, behavior which is inconsistent with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

  * r18114, r18681
    In mailer.py:
    Fix bug: named substitutions gathered from defaults.for_repos were being
    ignored for sections which contained a specific for_repos option (r18114),
    and for fallback invocations of the [defaults] section (r18681).
    Justification:
      This can enable extensive simplification of configurations which want
      to put the repository name into the *_subject_prefix options.

  * r18144, r18164, r18170, r18171, r18184, r18434
    and r18037, r18127 (only tools/dev/stress.pl)
    Add support for BDB-4.4 and automatic recovery of wedged databases.
    Justification:
      See above about automatic recovery of wedged databases.
    Notes:
      We found two bugs after this entry was written. Suggest we suspend
      voting until brane fixes them on trunk.

  * r18451
    Avoid asserting in repos to repos copies where the destination is a
    prefix of the source.
    Justification:
      Crash bad.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r18451 (-r18453:18454)
    Notes:
      Branch needed because 1.3.x doesn't have ra_reparent and because
      the tests have been moved in trunk.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, lundblad

  * r18665, r18668
    Branch: 1.3.x-ls_url_encoded
    Fix URL encoding bug in ls.
    Justification:
      Causes ls not to show locks always.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, rooneg

  * r18691, r18694
    Branch: 1.3.x-r18691
    Don't allow unlocking a path with the wrong lock token.
    Justification:
      The whole point of having lock tokens...

  * r18721
    Fix race condition during application pool initialization.
    Justification:
      Race conditions can cause difficult-to-reproduce crashes.

  * r18462, r18482
    Branch: 1.3.x-r18462

Approved changes:

  * r18254
    Fix parenthetisation in the SVN_BDB_VERSION_AT_LEAST macro.
    Justification:
      Avoids precedence bugs when used in boolean expressions.
    Note:
      Depends on r18144 et al. - unmergeable until those revs are merged.
