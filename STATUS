This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r31131
   Restore compatibility of svn_client_add3()'s non-recursive behavior.
   Notes:
     This fixes an API incompatibility.  But in practice it's a minor
     problem, and could probably wait until 1.5.1 if necessary.

 * r30746, r30747
   Fix a minor merge range notification header bug.
   Notes:
     r30747 is just cleanup of some cruft that snuck in with r30746,
     thus adhering to my "every commit should need a follow-up" ethos.

 * r30949, r30962
   Fix issue #3188.  Mergeinfo on switched targets/subtrees should elide
   to repos.

 * r31056
   Enable svn.diff in swig-py on Windows.

 * r31059, 31060, 31061, 31075, 31151.
   Fix issue #3157, Merging a change from a path's natural history
   creates self-referential mergeinfo
   Notes:
     r31075 and 31151 are the core fixes for the issue, the other revisions
     are a new test for it (and a few minor follow-ups to that test).
     The addition of the new merge test in r31059 trivally conflicts
     because several other new merge tests are not backported yet.

 * r30629, r30787
    mod_dontdothat: Allow opt-out of replay rejection.

      r30787 is a typo fix.

 * r31138, r31141, r31157
    Validate svn:date property values in libsvn_repos.
    Notes:
      r31141 is a docstring change.
      r31157 marks the regression test XFail over DAV.
