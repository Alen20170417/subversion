This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30215, r30221, r30225, r30226, r30230, r30243, r30286
   Simplify (UI-wise) yet vastly enhance the 'svn mergeinfo' subcommand and
   underlying APIs.
   Backport Branch:
     /branches/1.5.x-r30215
   Notes:
     If we approve this, we'll want to merge r30238 from the
     1.5.x-r30215 branch to trunk (to purge the APIs that never made
     it into 1.5).

 * r30161
   Fix bug in copy-on-update/ra_neon which prevents updates of nodes copied
   with property deletion.
   Notes:
     Fixes serious regression, with a test.
     Somebody more familiar with our WebDAV protocol should audit that code
     and similar parts of serf/mod_dav_svn to make sure there aren't similar
     problems remaining (deleting or opening nodes in a copied directory,
     say, although current copy-on-update code doesn't send copied
     directories).

 * r30278, r30279, r30285, r30299, r30304
   Update JavaHL bindings in light of r30215.
   Notes:
     This is dependent upon the r30215 group being merged.
     This group is functionally complete, but there is still a test failure
       in the JavaHL tests.
   Votes:

 * r29633
   Correct a bug in python tests' comparison of lists.

 * r29852, r29857
    Add a test for 2-URL merges from foreign repositories and some subsequent
    tweaks.
    Notes:
      We've alread merged r29742-r29744, r29746 to 1.5.x which improves
      foreign repos merging, we might as well add this test too.

 * r30246
   Don't discard wrapped abort_edit in cancellation editor.
   Notes:
     This bug has always been here; no need to hold the release for it.
