Status of 1.8.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1489885, r1489928
   Resolve regression where 'svn ci ci' just returned success when 'ci' doesn't
   exist in the working copy.
   Justification:
     Improves usability of 'svn', and of the status api (for api users).
   Notes:
     This introduces a warning/error for a specific case via the status walker,
     so I'm not 100% sure if we should introduce this patch in this form in
     1.8.1 or later.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (Needs more work. Breaks JavaHL)

 * r1491739, r1491755, r1491762, r1492152, r1492670, r1492682
   Improve interactive conflict resolution menu.
   Justification:
     The current menu is too hard to figure out for users.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2013-06/0147.shtml
     and http://blog.elegosoft.com/?q=updating-moves-in-subversion-18-just-ask
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1491816, r1494089
   Add two additional options to interactive file merge.
   Justification:
     Usability enhancement for quicker conflict resolution in some cases.
     Very simple change. Only affects interactive mode, not scripts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, danielsh

 * r1491868, r1494657
   Add missing conflict callback invocations to the update editor.
   Justification:
     Resolver is not invoked after some updates which flag new tree conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1491756
   Fix issue #4364: Correctly remove the stale entries from the lock table
   when committing deletions.
   Justification:
     Keep wc.db as consistent and clean as possible.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp
     +1 (nonbinding): schabi

 * r1493703, r1494171
   Fix upgrade notification for explicit upgrades of post-WC-NG working copies.
   Justification:
     Without this notification users can't see whether the upgrade was a no-op.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1495063
   r1495806, r1495985
   Fix crash in FSFS DAG caching code on strict-alignment architectures.
   Also, improve hash hash effectiveness and efficiency.
   Justification:
     FSFS shouldn't crash.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2013-06/0432.shtml
   Branch: 1.8.x-r1495063
   Notes:
     It took a while to figure out the "right way" to fix the hash function.
     The branch takes all the individual back-and-forth changes and combines
     them into one small patch.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, stsp

 * r1495329
   Use relative symlink for svnmucc in svn-tools.
   Justification:
     Makes 'make install-tools' work when DESTDIR is set.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -0: danielsh (the symlink should be absolute; see r1495329 thread)

 * r1492264
   Fix wrong character encoding handling of generic error messages
   in JavaHL
   Justification:
     Fixes a confusing bug where the generic error message generated by
     JavaHL is mangled due to wrong encoding, but the more specific messages
     generated by the native libraries are legible.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1496007, r1496111
   Fix issue #4383, "Subversion 1.8.0 crash when WC path is symlink"
   Justification:
     Crash, regression from 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +0: rhuijben (looks good)

 * r1496470
   Add runtime configuration option to control using of chunked transfer
   encoding for HTTP requests body.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1496470
   Justification:
     Workaround for issue with busted proxies that don't support chunked
     transfer encoding for request body. Reported many times on mailing list.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan
     -0: gstein, brane (we should dynamically detect the problem; should fix name)

 * r1496957
   Eliminate an extra RA layer roundtrip in 'svn log' on repository roots.
   Justification:
     Minor performance regression against 1.7.x plus requesting e.g. single
     revision logs on a repo root is not a fringe use-case.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1497002
   Avoid temporary files when calling external diff. Fixes issue 4382.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1497310
   Backport 'svn help cleanup' improvements made in r1497310.
   Justification:
     The current output doesn't explain what the command actually does.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1497310-partial
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1497318
   Better explain working copy locks in 'svn help status' output.
   Justification:
     The current documentation can be misleading for users who might
     not know what the purpose of the lock is.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, brane

 * r1497319
   Better explain exclusive-commit locks in 'svn help status' output.
   Justification:
     The current documentation can be misleading for users who might not
     know what a 'lock token' is, or what the purpose of the lock is.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, brane

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1497551
   Fix the Accept-Encoding header format
   Justification:
     When IIS is used as a reverse-proxy, it chokes. And we should use the
     format from the specification anyways :-P

     +1: gstein, brane, danielsh
