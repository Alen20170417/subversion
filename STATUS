This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.


Status of 1.4.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21249, r21251, r21253, r21254
    Fix a bug in the svn_fs_closest_copy() implementations that caused
    confusing errors when tracing certain node locations.  See issue #2600.
    Notes:
      The bugfix is in r21254 -- all the others just add regression tests.

  * r21357
    Python/SWIG crash when apr_hash_t typemap is used.
    Votes:
      +1: djames

  * r21384, r21047
    A merge which results in a conflicted file in your WC should
    produce a "conflicted" merge notification.  'svn merge --dry-run'
    needs to be smarter about accessing the working copy (see issue
    #2584).
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r21392
    Fix the Python bindings tests so that they use URLs which work
    on Windows.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r21392
    Votes:
      +1: djames

  * r21471
    Dramatically speed up WC to WC copy post commit processing.
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos

  * r21473
    Fix compile error when APR_HAS_DSO is not defined (e.g. on RISC OS).
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r21483
    Improve error checking when running external commands (e.g. hook scripts).
    Justification:
      At the moment, unexpected errors encountered while checking a
      process's exit status result in assigning it a random exit status.

  * r21531
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow use of GSSAPI/SSPI auth on Windows with Neon 0.26.1+.

      -1: cmpilato (new features showing up in patch releases?  nuh-uh.)

  * r21566, r21638, r21641, r21669, r21685, r21696, r21705
    Fix issue #2533, making 'svn status -u' show remotely changed
    properties on the root of a working copy.
    Justification:
      A user reported bug with a straightforward fix, plus regression
      test.
    Branch: 1.4.x-issue-2533
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, pburba

  * r21657, r21662
    Fix issue #2602, making 'svn co URL@{DATE}' work.
    Justification:
      Brokenness.
    Notes:
      Revision should merge fine, but the regression test will get
      skipped (because there's no checkout_tests.py).  Test was
      introduced in r21275.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, dlr

  * r21720, r21724, r21726
    Fix issue #2618: 'Checksum mismatch' error when receiving update for
    locally replaced-with-history file.
    Justification:
      Breaks working copy update; includes tests.
    Branch: 1.4.x-issue-2618
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos

  * r21738
    Prevent an API violation from corrupting FSFS repositories, as seen
    in issue #2467 and reports from users.
    Justification:
      Silently corrupting the repository is a Bad Thing.
    Notes:
      Branch needed to avoid the backport of a new error code.
    Concerns:
      This isn't exactly a trivial fix.  We are also assuming that this
      is the cause of the corruption we've seen.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r21738 (-c21763)

  * r21765, r21767
    JavaHL: Compile Java bytecode for the target platform of a Java
    1.2 JVM.
    Justification:
      The default target platform release number is typically equal to
      the compiling JDK version, which is likely much higher than our
      supported minimum runtime (Java 1.2).
    Votes:

  * r21770
    JavaHL: Fix a JVM crash when the empty string is passed to the
    checkout() method.
    Justification:
      SEGVs and JVM crashes are bad.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r21792
    Fix crash that occurs when opening a working copy is interupted.
    Justification:
      Apparently this is causing 80% of the TortoiseSVN crashes for 1.4.0.

Approved changes:

  * r21293
    Neon 0.26.x compatibility for Windows build.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, dlr, rooneg

  * r21575
    Update the URL for the svnmerge.py wiki page.
    Justification:
      Bad to send out old URLs.  Documentation only commit.
    Votes:
      +1: blair, dlr

  * r21592
    Add the -l or --log command line option in svn_all_diffs.pl's
    usage message.
    Justification:
      Without a usage message documenting it, people won't know it's
      there unless they browse the source code.
    Votes:
      +1: blair, dlr

  * r21609
    Make it possible to check out repositories with spaces in ther names over
    ra_svn.
    Justification:
      Simple fix.  User reported problem.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, dlr, cmpilato

  * r21526
    Pass path, not url, in to ne_lock_discover.
    Justification:
      Neon wants the path, it's only by chance that the URL usually works.
