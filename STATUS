This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.5:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1498000
   Improve error handling for inherited property requests by using the
   transition based xml parser in libsvn_ra_serf.
   Justification:
     This maintenance work which usually doesn't belong in a patch release
     makes it possible to properly detect if this request should be restarted
     on non-chunk-enabled proxies.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1496127
   Fix occasional failure of checkout_tests.py 12.
   Justification:
     Spurious FAILs confuse people testing the release.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     -0: danielsh (loses functionality; patch sent with alternative fix)
     stsp: where exactly is the alternative patch?
     danielsh: http://mid.gmane.org/20130705040533.GL3244@lp-shahaf.local

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben
     -0: ivan (not regression from 1.7.x, destructive change in libsvn_wc core)

 * r1501656, r1501702
   Fix the ability to build Debug Build with BDB FS on Windows.
   Justification:
     Our build system should work properly.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Not a regression and I don't think we should encourage
                   building with just a debug BDB (even for release mode)
                   by backporting this change. That would require using the
                   non-distributable debug CRT. Trunk has a cleaner
                   detection of BDB (via db.h) and even while debugging a
                   maintainer build of Subversion a release BDB works fine)

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1534149
   In the windows CryptoAPI ssl certificate verification, properly handle
   certificates that are only trusted via intermediate authorities.
   Justification:
      While not strictly a bug, intermediate authorities are getting more
      common since recent Certificate Authority incidents.
   Notes:
      rhuijben: This introduces a new credential type as private API.
      Not sure about our strict ABI guarantees here, but this affects
      usability of users migrating to cloud platforms, etc.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1533530
   Fix latency issue when reusing svnserve connections.
   Justification:
      This simple patch affects all operations that run multiple requests
      over the same connection.  It should improve things like e.g. merge.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1499470
   Flush stdout before exiting svn with an error.
   Justification:
      Without this patch merge_tests.py 135 may fail to output its required
      output.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1535115
   Make JavaHL tests run without installing on OS X.
   Justification:
     Shouldn't need to install code to test it.
   Votes:
     +1: breser

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1534860
   Remove -fwhole_program flag from optimized GCC builds.
   Justification:
     As described in http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html,
     -flto is superior and should not be combined with -fwhole-program.
     As it turns out, -fwhole_program causes issues with llvm and other
     sources indicated that the flag might not be particularly useful to
     begin with.
