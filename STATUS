Status of 1.8.11:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: ivan, brane (not regression from 1.7.x,
                      destructive change in libsvn_wc core)
     -0: rhuijben (temporarily remove my +1 until I complete investigating
                   a related problem. It looks like this fix doesn't work for
                   the user scenario it was intended for)

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser

 * r1590751
   Use empty, rather than NULL, config if default is unreadable.
   Justification:
     svn SEGV reported by user.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -0: julianfoad (prefer to fix all the programs at the same time;
                     other queries -- see email thread)

 * r1561419, r1561427, 1547489, r1560643, r1573744
   Fix the hotcopy and recovery for pre-1.4 FSFS repositories.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1573744-and-friends
   Justification:
     Without this, old SVN versions won't be able to e.g. hotcopy those
     repos once 1.8.x made a commit in them.  Also, fix our hotcopy code
     and make it cope with repositories broken by previous 1.8.x releases.
   Notes:
     The best way to review this is to review the backporting result in
     r1640603 instead of inspecting the original patches.
     "r1573744" is a bit of a misnomer as only the test case got backported
     because the workflow problem fixed by it does not exist in 1.8.x.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1643074
   Don't let invalid mergeinfo stop 'svnadmin load' from working.
     Part of issue #4476 "Mergeinfo containing r0 makes svnsync and svnadmin
     dump fail".
   Justification:
     The presence of 'bad' metadata in a repository should not prevent
     backing up and restoring from a backup, given that this data does not
     make the repository totally unusable.
   Notes:
     The 'svnadmin dump' part of this issue was already backported in v1.8.9.
     The 'svnsync' part of this issue is not yet fixed.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1643074
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1640862, r1640873, r1643793
   Work with libtool 2.4.3
   Justification:
     libtool 2.4.3 is needed to build properly on OS X 10.10
   Votes:
     +1: breser, brane (without r1643793)
     +1: philip

 * r1643810
   Avoid unneeded memory growth in mod_dav resource walking (issue 4531)
   Justification:
     Some copy operations failed in certain user scenarios, with really huge
     trees.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -1: breser (see my email to dev@, <5282FE15.40505@reser.org>)
