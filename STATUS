This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1186784
   Fix a 'configure' error message to make sense when '--with-berkeley-db'
   is given and Berkeley DB > 4 is linked into APR-UTIL.
   Justification:
     Save headaches.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, danielsh

 * r1186928
   Don't rely on the current implementation of svn_ra_get_mergeinfo to
   avoid a segfault when asking for mergeinfo from a repository which isn't
   mergeinfo capable.
   Justification:
     Avoid segfaults by relying on undocumented API behavior is never a
     good idea.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

Approved changes:
