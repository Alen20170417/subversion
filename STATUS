This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520
   Silence compiler warnings.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     -0: philip (see dev thread: it's a false alarm, wrong value)

 * r1469862, r1469866, r1475704
   Change configure default to --without-apache-libexecdir.
   Justification:
     Before this change, by default, Apache modules would very likely be
     installed outside of $prefix, while still being linked with shared
     libraries in $prefix. This is not expected behaviour.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, philip
     +0: danielsh (refraining from defaulting to ${httpd_libexecdir} is sane)

 * r1470031
   Correctly set the 'action' and 'reason' fields of a property conflict.
   API users were seeing the wrong 'action' and 'reason' for some property
   conflicts. 'svn' does not yet use these fields.
   Justification:
     It's wrong.  It's simple.  Fixing it in a 1.x.0 release involves less
     risk of interfering with any client's work-around for the bug.  We may
     want to backport changes to 'svn' to report property conflicts better,
     and then 'svn' may use these fields; I'm working on such a change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, philip
     +0.5: rhuijben (after this patch the situation is better, but I'm not
                     sure if it is optimal. In merge there are 4 trees to
                     consider before we can tell the reason. The 4th tree
                     is available as the pristine version of the local node)

 * r1470238, r1471153
   Improve labelling of the file diff in interactive conflict resolution 'df'
   option. Show labels such as "THEIRS" and "MERGED", not just the paths to
   the files on disk.
   Justification:
     It was confusing because the same 'df' option can show a different pair
     of files depending on whether the conflicted operation was an update or
     a merge, and on whether there's a base file or not.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, philip

 * r1470246
   Improve the interactive resolution of property conflicts.  Instead of
   showing the contents of the '.prej' file once for each prop conflict, show
   initially a single line such as
     "local delete, incoming edit upon merge"
   (similar to resolving a text conflict) and allow the user to display a 3-way
   diff by adding a 'dc - display conflict' option.
   Justification:
     Showing the whole .prej file each time was confusing and ugly when more
     than one property was in conflict.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1470904, r1471744, r1475963, r1476155, r1476181, r1476254
   Tweak an upgrade Sql statement to be easier to understand and a tiny bit
   faster
   Justification:
     The old variant had some theoretical upgrade problems.
   Notes:
     r1470904, r1471744, r1475963 are a series of tweaks to the
     STMT_UPGRADE_31_SELECT_WCROOT_NODES query.  r1476155 is a new
     upgrade test.  r1476181, r1476254 are for 1.6 upgrades.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (only r1470904 and r1471744)
     +1: philip
     +1: pburba (not r1476181, r1476254)

 * r1471443, r1471490
   Fix a bug in the Summary of Conflicts when using interactive conflict
     resolution.  Marking a text conflict as resolved but leaving a prop
     conflict unresolved on the same file, or vice versa, would decrement
     both the text and prop conflict summary stats.
   Justification:
     Regression since 1.7.
   Notes:
     r1471443 is just a removal of unused code, and is included here in
     order to avoid conflicts.  r1471490 is the main change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

* r1475772, r1476092
  Fix a bug in authz file processing where group and user names were
  not treated case-sensitively, which could lead to unpredictable
  results depending on the ordering of the authz config entries.
  See http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4361
  Justification:
    See above about unpredictable results. A related fix for
    repository paths handling was made in 1.7.0.
  Notes:
    r1476092 is the CHANGES update.
  Votes:
    +1: brane

 * r1476193
   Reset SQLite statements on error during 1.7 to 1.8 upgrade.
   Justification:
     Avoid SQLITE_MISUSE errors.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================


Approved changes:
=================

 * r1470248
   Fix a little error in 'svn info' whereby it would print the path to the
   '.prej' file multiple times if multiple properties were in conflict.
   Justification:
     Regression since v1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben, pburba

 * r1471028
   Fix issue 4359, incorrect/missing pack notification.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6.
   Notes:
     We already incorrectly merged r1471029 which is not a ^/subversion commit.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben, julianfoad

 * r1475724
   Fix changelist filtering when --changelist values aren't UTF8.
   Justification:
     User-reported buglet that prevents the use of changelist
     filtering altogether for those sorts of changelist names.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, philip, julianfoad
