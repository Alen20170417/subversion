Status of 1.7.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1186944, r1186981, r1186983, r1187676
   Fix an assertion failure when a symlink is updated.
   Justification:
     Regression in 1.7.0.
   Notes:
     r1186944 is the actual fix, including a new test
     r1186981 fixes spurious failures of the new test
     r1186983 whitespace to avoid conflict
     r1187676 is a cosmetic follow-up tweak
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1187695
   Have mod_dav_svn ignore non-Subversion POST requests.
   Justification:
     mod_dav_svn does not play well with others, a regression from 1.6.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1188652, r1188677, r1188762
   Fix issue 4042, commit incomplete directory asserts.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (Patch appears ok. Will bump to +1 after further review)

 * r1188774, 1197135
   Fix issue #4044, "empty parents of externals not removed along with
   externals on update".
   Justification:
     Currently empty unversioned directories are left behind, possibly
     obstructing future updates which re-add the directory.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1189261
   Bump copyright year in Windows executables and DLLs to 2011 (from 2009).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba
     +0: philip (looks sensible, but I'm not a Windows expert)

 * r1199876
   Fix issue 4048, wcng assert on update with 1.0.x server.
   Justification:
     Our client-server compatibility rules require this to work.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1201824
   Fix issue #2873.
   Justification:
     svn diff -c N on a file added in revision N is broken.
     Not a regression from 1.6.x but backporting this fix is easy
     because it needs no public API changes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1201824
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1202630
   Catch base files with no checksum.
   Justification:
      Prevents corrupt wc, will help track down the issue 4062 upgrades.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, stsp

 * r1202783
   Log root cause, rather than generic error, when opening rep-cache.db fails.
   Justification:
      Makes the real cause visible to the server admin.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     =0: danielsh (disagrees with the choice of implementation. see list)

 * r1203546
   Fix nested Locations when using v2 protocol.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6 unless v2 protocol is disabled.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

Approved changes:
