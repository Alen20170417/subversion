This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29155
   Allow packagers to build some parts of svn against installed svn libs.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

Approved changes:

 * r29434, r29436, r29438
   Copy-on-update can use loggy incorrectly, and possibly lead to dataloss
   Notes: although the issue #2986 summary doesn't say so, r29438
          actually fixed a dataloss bug (a file could end up with
          properties that no one had ever intended to put on it).
          r29434 and r29436 are just regression tests for r29438.
