This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30574
   Use `neon-config --libs` when `neon-config --la-file` isn't available.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, cmpilato

 * r30644, r30668
   Make --record-only merges record and elide mergeinfo on subtrees.
   Notes:
     Record only merges without this functionality are a lot less useful.
     30644 will conflict if the r30633 group is not applied first.

Status of 1.5.1:

Candidate changes:

Approved changes (all releases):
================================

 * r30678
   Include svn_wc_notify_foreign_merge_begin mapping in JavaHL.
   Notes:
     This depends on the r30633 group, which has already been merged.
     Also, because this changes the values of contants in JavaHL, it should be
     either merged or reverted on trunk.
