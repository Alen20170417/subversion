This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.

For example, to merge a number of revisions from trunk into branch,
you can use the svnmerge.py script that is in the branch.

$ contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py merge -r 21000-21006,21008,21876
$ svn diff
$ svn commit

Do not run svnmerge.py N separate times for each revision to merge
over, since svnmerge.py will not merge into a WC with uncommitted
changes.

Status of 1.4.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r22311
    Make svn_ra_do_{update,switch,status} work with the SWIG/Perl bindings.
    Notes:
      Backport was originally attempted in r22694, but merge was
      botched due to an incomplete listing in STATUS (r22311 itself
      backported, but there is additional supporting code required to
      make this change functional).  Probably needs a backport branch.
    Justification:
      Would be nice to fix something we already said we'd fixed in 1.4.3.

  * r23115,r23117-23118
    Fix issue 2700: commit of locked file fails when no write access on root
    Justification:
      Fix for bug reported a few times on dev&users, includes test.
    Branch: 1.4.x-issue-2700 (-r23124:HEAD)

      +1: lgo, cmpilato

  * r21989, r22884, r23347-23349, r23357, r23359, r23363, r23364, r23384,
    r23385, r23387, r23395, r23763, r23764, r23794, r23795, r23799, r23807
    Bring mucc and mucc-test.py up to date with respect to trunk,
    except for r23427, which uses svn_stringbuf_from_file2() in 1.5.
    Justification:
      This is becoming a very useful tool for making restructuring
      commits that would otherwise require extremely large working
      copies.
    Notes:
      Blair ran mucc-test.py against this merge and it passed the
      test.  The person doing the merge should ensure that mucc-test.sh is
      deleted, as svnmerge.py skips that for some reason.  Also, if
      a test merge run is done with without committing and then
      reverting, then also delete the new mucc-test.py, since the
      next svnmerge.py will ignore it the second time around.

  * r24073, r24126, r24128
    Fix issue #2751: Directory prop mods reverted in overlapping
      commits scenario.
    Justification:
      At the root of it, its very unexpected behavior that allows a commit
      to undo property changes without the committer being aware of it.
      But in the BDB case (at least), it has the horrific side-effect of
      setting the stage for a cycle in the representations table delta
      chain.  In case you're wondering, that's oh-so-bad.

  * r23217, r23223, r23225, r23226, r23227, r23231, r23232
    Fix issue #2705, with tests: repos_replay failed
      on revisions with copy-with-modifications from
      unreadable directories.
    Justification:
      Prevents ra_replay (svnsync, SVK) on real-world repositories,
      like r120621 in the GCC repo if syncing trunk only.
    Notes:
      glasser (nominating this) only tested that merge was clean and
      did not run tests.

  * r23439, r23440
    Fix race condition in changing revprops under FSFS by requiring
      use of the FSFS write lock.  (r23440 is the fix itself; r23439
      rearranges files so that the appropriate function can access
      the write lock code in fs_fs.c)
    Justification:
      If two clients try to update *different* revprops on the same
      revision at the same time, you can lose the first change.  Data
      loss bad.
    Notes:
      glasser (nominating this) only tested that merge was clean and
      did not run tests.

 * r23910
   Fix issue 1789: large 'svn diff' on Win32 fails
   Justification:
     'svn diff' is a rather common use-case, change only
     does a fallback for one specific (Windows) error code
   Votes:
     +1: dionisos, dlr

 * r24219
   Fix error reporting for JavaHL's info2() API.
   Justification:
     Otherwise mis-reports itself as unlock().
   Votes:
     +1: dlr, hwright

  * r23906
    Fix argument passing in one of JavaHL's update() wrappers.
    Justification:
      The API should behave as described, not ignore parameters in favor of
      defaults.
    Votes:
      +1: hwright

  * r23978
    Wrap a call from one of JavaHL's synchronized methods in a synchronized()
      block.
    Justification:
      Small fix.  Our synchronized client should fulfill its promise to be
      synchronized.

Veto-blocked changes:

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.
    Votes:

      -1: cmpilato (new features showing up in patch releases?  nuh-uh.)

  * r21885, r22076
    Add a new RPM package for the AuroraLinux 2.0 SPARC distribution.
    Justification:
      It is a combination of RHEL3 and RHEL4 distributions with
      characteristics matching both, so we need a new directory.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r22076 (-r22079:HEAD)
    Votes:
      +1: dws
      -1: maxb (It appears that the auroralinux-2 directory has been based
                on an old version of the rhel-3 directory, pre-dating some
                of the difference-reduction work I did to try to minimize the
                unnecessary inconsistencies between the various distro
                flavours. Its introduction therefore represents a regression
                in the maintainability of the RPM packaging area as a whole.)

  * r19808-19810, r22853
    Synchronise license text and then bump copyright dates to 2007.
    Justification:
      It's 2007.
    Notes: We might want to wait until we actually merge something we
      originally committed in 2007, possibly hold until 1.4.4?
    Votes:
      +1: malcolm, dlr, hwright
      -1: jerenkrantz (This is an unnecessary change to backport.)
