delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10604
    Cleanup some qsort-related stuff.
    Justification:
      Removes *4* redundant functions, but adds a new API.
    Notes:
      The docstring for svn_sort_compare_paths says "New in 1.1."
      and needs to be updated to say 1.2 if this does not go in.

  * r10674
    Make ./configure behave nicer in the presence of old Apache.
    Justification:
      Tiny patch. If a user has an old apache on their system, but didn't ask
      us to use it, we shouldn't abort ./configure, just don't use it.

  * r10731
    Fix svn_path_dirname() so it returns canonical paths when passed a path
      with the last segment separated by multiple slashes.
    Justification:
      API contract violation.

  * r10775
    Wrap svn_config_enumerator_t for Perl bindings.
    Justification:
      Perl bindings only; completeness.
    Votes:
      +1: clkao

  * r10782, r10824
    Fix FSFS changed-path handling
    Justification:
      Bug can cause FSFS to fail to report some changed-paths, leading to
      data loss because those paths aren't included in a dump.
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson, bliss

  * r10800 (Issue #2031)
    Add -lstdc++ to javahl binding DSO at link-time.
    Justification:
      The javahl shared library does not link correctly on certain platforms.
      (This is really a libtool bug.)

  * r10794
    Add the new boolean config file option store-passwords.
    Justification:
      Unintrusive change.  Much more user friendly than store-auth-creds
      because username, SSL server cert trust, etc, is still saved.
    Votes:
       +1: bliss, ghudson

  * r10819
    Avoid repository corruption if executed with closed std{in,out,err}
    Justification:
      Simple fix for a nasty problem that has bitten at least one user.
    Votes:
       +1: bliss, maxb, ghudson
       -1: brane [until someone explains to me why this should be a
                  Unix-only change]

  * r10841
    Fix crash bug in "svn st -u" on out-of-sync working copies
    Justification:
      Crashes bad.
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson
