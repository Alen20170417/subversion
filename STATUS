This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

As of 1.1.0-rc3, 1.1.0 is in its final one-week soak period.  Any code
changes made to 1.1.0 necessitate restarting the final one-week soak.
(See HACKING for the precise definition of which changes necessitate a
resoak.)  If you are proposing a code change for 1.1.0, make a note of
whether it warrants a resoak on its own; otherwise, the change may be
folded in if some other change warrants a resoak, but will be moved to
1.1.1 if not.

Candidate changes:

Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10788, r10796, r10904, r10914
    Fix performance regression in character encoding translations.  Most
    noticable on Win32, but impacts other platforms as well.
    Justification:
      Slow "svn status" annoys people, especially TSVN users.
    Notes:
      Proposed during 1.1.0 preparation, but it is too late and complicated
      to put in 1.1.0 at this stage.

  * r11172
    Fix encoding bug in svnlook log and author.

  * r11190
    Make it possible to set SVNPathAuthz to Off.
    Justification:
      There is a performance regression from 1.0 when it's set to On
      (which is why it was implemented in the first place).

  * r11211
    Fix performance regression for ls/RA->get_dir over ra_rav.
    Justification:
      Positively huge performance regression.

  * r11224 (Issue 2070)
    Exporting symlinks with use-commit times set fails.
