This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10389, r10398:
    Don't always patch the apr-util files for BDB when generating
    Windows build scripts (introduced in r10206).
    Justification:
      trivial fix, avoids breaking the apr-util build by mistake,
      will make my life easier as long as the 1.1.x branch is live.
      r10389 is a doc and utility fix for r10206.
    Votes:
      +3: brane. That should be enough :-)
      +0: breser. Don't know enough about the Windows build to be +1

  * r10379,r10380,r10384,r10469,r10470,r10487
    Support creation of zip archives for Windows.
    Justification:
      Long since planed.
    Notes:
      r10487 really doesn't need a vote, but I included it for completness.
    Votes:
      +1: breser, kfogel
