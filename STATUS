================

Candidate changes:

 * r17039, r17051
   Fix issue 767: Commit uses temporary file in current directory.
   Remark:
     Commits in read-only directories therefore fail.  This revision adds
     graceful fallback.

 * r16568, r17123
   Make svn info not error out on paths that don't exist in future revs.
   Justification:
     Regression with a simple fix; affects TSVN.
   Notes:
     r16568 is just a docstring fix to avoid conflicts.

 * r17127
   Fix broken JavaHL status API for retrieving last committed revision.
   Justification:
     The previous implementation use wrong return type (it's amazing
     it even compiled), and thus not usable by Subclipse.

 * r17129
   Fix broken tests in svnmerge_test.py by disabling keyword expansion.
   Justification:
     It is a new test for a new program. It got broken while importing
     it into the repository. The patch just disables keyword expansion
     and restore the original text.
