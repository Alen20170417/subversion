This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      (at least) Windows and Mac OS X, behavior which is inconsistent
      with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

  * r17829, r17831
    Fix issue # 1456: Subversion RedHat RPMs have bad interaction with NFS
    server/client.  This was easily accomplished by just making a package
    change to set the -rpath correctly during package building.
    Justification:
      Prevents spurious NFS and AUTOMOUNT messages in log files.

  * r18144, r18037, r18127 (only tools/dev/stress.pl)
    Add support for BDB-4.4 and automatic recovery of wedged databases.
    Justification:
      See above about automatic recovery of wedged databases.

  * r18146
    Don't block waiting for background jobs of hook scripts.
    Justification:
      Regression (introduced in 1.3.0), which can delay a Subversion
      server's response when triggering a hook which backgrounds a
      long-runinng process.

Approved changes:

  * r18021
    Update copyright dates shown in the command-line clients.
    Justification:
      If we're updating the copyright dates shown in the Windows version
      information dialog, we may as well be consistent and update the
      output of the command-line clients too.

  * r18078
    The svn:date property should be set at the end of a commit, while it's
    being finalized, not just at the beginning.
    Justification:
      Can result in out of order svn:date revprops with fsfs.  Simple fix.

  * r18127 (only build/win32/svn.rc)
    Fix copyright dates shown in Subversion Windows binaries.
    Justification:
      Up to and including 1.3.0, those dates were still 2000-2004...
