Candidate changes:

  * r17242, r17243
    Fix issue #2436, svn mv --force <unversioned file>, <unversiond file>

  * r17333, [and friends...]
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: [merge branch to-be-created]
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      (at least) Windows and Mac OS X, behavior which is inconsistent
      with Linux.

  * r17829, r17831

  * r17910
    Fix the ability to link libsvn_swig_py on Solaris 10 when
    compiling with GCC 3.4.2.
    Justification:
      Allows successful builds of the Python bindings in a relatively
      common situation on Solaris via a minor tweak to our build
      machinery which restores its behavior from Subversion 1.2.3 and
      earlier.  The new behavior is required only for Cygwin, and this
      change makes that (conditionally) so.

      +1: dlr

  * r17956
    Fix a regression which caused 'svn ci -m path_name' to no longer require
    --force-log.
    Justification:
      Regression.

  * r17726, r17925
    Fix conversion bug.
    Justification:
      Without this change, copyfrom_path and copyfrom_rev can't be gotten.
