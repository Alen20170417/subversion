Candidate changes:
==================

  * r1818651, r1818662, r1818727, r1818801, r1818803, r1818807, r1818868, r1818871, r1819162
    Improve lz4,utf8proc configure behavior, and print the lz4 version in --version -v
    Justification:
      Correctly detect, note and print dependencies for builders/packagers.
    Votes:
     +1: stefan2, astieger
     +1: jamessan (without r1819162)

 * r1819093
   Introduce a new global option: --password-from-stdin
   Justification:
     Small, useful, self-contained feature written by a new contributor.
     It would be nice if this were released in 1.10 because otherwise the
     contributor would have to wait for a very long time to see the result
     of their work in a release.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, stefan2

 * r1818578, r1819037, r1819049, r1819052
   Fix svn_dirent_t.size API inconsistency
   Justification:
     Our APIs should behave as document and consistenly across all RA layers.
     API changes should go into 1.10.0.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1818577, r1819146
   Fix test suite handling of pre-cooked repositories 
   Justification:
     We want our test suite to pass with fsfs-v4 repos as it did in 1.9.
     As a bonus, it will also work with fsfs-v3 now.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1819036, r1819043
   Switch 'svn ls --search' on Windows to sub-string matching.
   Justification:
     The new feature was mostly unusable on the Windows CLI.  With this
     CLI-only work-around, it becomes worthwhile again.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1818584
   Fix crash when exiting 'svnserve --config-file'.
   Justification:
     This is a user-reported crash. The underlying container type is now also
     part of the authz infrastructure and should be as robust as possible.
