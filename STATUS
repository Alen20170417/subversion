This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30666, r30684
   Cache repository UUID, have update check that it matches.
   Notes: Not strictly necessary for 1.5.0, but would be nice to get
     the new svn_ra_open3() API in if we can.  If we do backport,
     make sure to change "New in 1.6" to "New in 1.5", of course.

 * r30644, r30668
   Make --record-only merges record and elide mergeinfo on subtrees.
   Notes:
     Record only merges without this functionality are a lot less useful.
     30644 will conflict if the r30633 group is not applied first.
