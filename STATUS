 * r1704292, r1704573
   Make svn diff --git produce proper forward binary diffs

     going to work for our 1.10 'svn patch' implementation.

     +1: rhuijben

   Fix svn_fs_contents_different on FSFS producing false negatives.
   Justification:
     Under rare circumstances, see issue #4554, the API may not recognize
     two file contents as being different.  This may result in incomplete
     reports and dump files.

   Clarify documentation of svn_fs_node_created_rev().
