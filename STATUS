This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1468395, r1468566
   Introduce typedef for the svn_fs_freeze() callback function type,
   and give it the requisite SWIG/Python wrapper treatment.
   Justification:
     Without this, the callback is useless in SWIG/Python

     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben

 * 1469478, r1469489, r1469512
   Fix issue 4356, status SEGV after incomplete move
   Justification:
     It's a SEGV.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1469519, r1469520
   Silence compiler warnings.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: blair

 * r1469550
   Fix a potential segfault in merge.
   Justification:
     It's a segfault (though I haven't bothered to make it happen)
   Votes:
     +1: breser, philip

 * r1469556
   Load hooks env in svn_repos_fs_change_rev_prop4() properly.
   Justification:
     Security issue, possible case where hooks environment doesn't get loaded.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, philip

 * r1469862, r1469866
   Change configure default to --without-apache-libexecdir.
   Justification:
     Before this change, by default, Apache modules would very likely be
     installed outside of $prefix, while still being linked with shared
     libraries in $prefix. This is not expected behaviour.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1469871
   Make the conflict prompt correctly localised again.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.  Needed quickly so translators can get their
     translations done.  <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2013-04/0429.shtml>
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, philip

 * r1469994
   Make "h" and "?" work at the conflict prompt as promised by the help text.
   Justification:
     User annoyance.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, philip

 * r1470031
   Correctly set the 'action' and 'reason' fields of a property conflict.
   API users were seeing the wrong 'action' and 'reason' for some property
   conflicts. 'svn' does not yet use these fields.
   Justification:
     It's wrong.  It's simple.  Fixing it in a 1.x.0 release involves less
     risk of interfering with any client's work-around for the bug.  We may
     want to backport changes to 'svn' to report property conflicts better,
     and then 'svn' may use these fields; I'm working on such a change.
