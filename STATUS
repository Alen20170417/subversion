    Upgrade SWIG bindings to be compatible with SWIG 1.3.26-1.3.28

  * r18114, r18681
    In mailer.py:
    Fix bug: named substitutions gathered from defaults.for_repos were being
    ignored for sections which contained a specific for_repos option (r18114),
    and for fallback invocations of the [defaults] section (r18681).
    Justification:
      This can enable extensive simplification of configurations which want
      to put the repository name into the *_subject_prefix options.

  * r18504, r18509
    Add svnauthz-validate tool.
    Justification:
      Useful tool, low impact.
    Notes:
      Take diff to build.conf from r18509 then copy all of tools/server-side
      from r18509, it's all that's in that directory.

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      Windows, behavior which is inconsistent with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

Approved changes:

  * r18254
    Fix parenthetisation in the SVN_BDB_VERSION_AT_LEAST macro.
    Justification:

      Depends on r18144 et al. - unmergeable until those revs are merged.
