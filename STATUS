================

Candidate changes:

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16693
    Fix crash in libsvn_ra_dav's get_repos_root.
    Justification:
      Crash bad.  Our own code doesn't trigger this, but other library
      users might.
