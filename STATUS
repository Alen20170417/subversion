Status of 1.8.11:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: ivan, brane (not regression from 1.7.x,
                      destructive change in libsvn_wc core)
     -0: rhuijben (temporarily remove my +1 until I complete investigating
                   a related problem. It looks like this fix doesn't work for
                   the user scenario it was intended for)

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +0: breser (I'd be +1 if not for the unused function in svnadmin_tests.py;
                 without r1640560)

 * r1555491
   Fix svn_fs_close_root for FSFS transaction roots.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, cache-related pool cleanups may be run after the
     svn_fs_t object has been destroyed.  I.e. even with explicit calls to
     svn_fs_close_root, the user may see a segfault.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1555491
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     -0: philip, rhuijben (Seems to be a different name for the same pool?)

 * r1590751
   Use empty, rather than NULL, config if default is unreadable.
   Justification:
     svn SEGV reported by user.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -0: julianfoad (prefer to fix all the programs at the same time;
                     other queries -- see email thread)

 * r1625533, r1625537
   Keep externals registrations on 'svn upgrade' (part of issue 4519)
   Justification:
     'svn upgrade' shouldn't destroy valid information.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1625533
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -0: philip (needs a backport for apr_hash_this_key. Before branch)

 * r1628536
   Fix issue #4085, "external can shadow a versioned directory".
   Justification:
     Bug that can lead to a working copy which cannot be updated
     until a directory shadowing an external, which was switched
     to the external's location by the externals handling code,
     is switched back to its original path.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1633126
   Improve performance of recorded timestamp fixups in svn cleanup
   Justification:
     Fixing timestamps on a working copy with properly recorded timestamps
     should not cost 10* the time of walking the working copy for status.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1633126
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1637826
   Fix typos in LIBTOOL_M4 and LIBTOOL_CONFIG expansion in autogen.sh
   Justification:
     Makes no sense to tell users to set environment variables
     to fix builds with libtool in a nonstandard location, if we
     then don't interpret said environment variables correctly.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1561419, r1561427, 1547489, r1560643, r1573744
   Fix the hotcopy and recovery for pre-1.4 FSFS repositories.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1573744-and-friends
   Justification:
     Without this, old SVN versions won't be able to e.g. hotcopy those
     repos once 1.8.x made a commit in them.  Also, fix our hotcopy code
     and make it cope with repositories broken by previous 1.8.x releases.
   Notes:
     The best way to review this is to review the backporting result in
     r1640603 instead of inspecting the original patches.
     "r1573744" is a bit of a misnomer as only the test case got backported
     because the workflow problem fixed by it does not exist in 1.8.x.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

  * r1640730
    Use sync Gnome Keyring API as our use of the async is not thread safe.
    Justification:
      Fix issue 3498: eclipse IDE crashes.
    Votes:
      +1: philip, markphip

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -1: breser (see my email to dev@, <5282FE15.40505@reser.org>)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1621978, r1621981
   Fix changelist filtering for repos-WC and WC-WC diffs.
   Justification:
     Changelist filtering, enabled by "svn diff --cl foo" for example, was
     broken (it crashed in common cases) and incomplete even if the crash
     were avoided. See email thread "Segmentation fault during diff generation"
     starting at <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2014-08/0325.shtml>.
