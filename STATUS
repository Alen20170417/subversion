This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14024
    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.
    Justification:
      Encourages hacking on the bindings, and improves user confidence.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, fitz (concept)

  * r14280
    Build ZLib from sources on Windows.
    Justification:
      Cures major PITA for Windows developers, improves debugging support.
    Concerns:
      Not exactly a showstopper for 1.2.0.
    Votes:
      +0.9: brane (+1 for 1.2.1)

  * r14286
    Make "make davautocheck" work for locking and work out-of-the-box
    on more systems.
    Justification:
      Makes it easier to test over DAV; not a core code change.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, fitz

  * r14046, r14070, r14301
    Improvements in the testing framework
    Justification:
      Low impact; r14046 and r14070 should've been on the 1.2.x branch
      from day one. r14301 speeds up testing on Windows, where three
      tests run in parallel take hardly any more time than a single test.
      Not a core code change.
    Votes:
      +1: brane, fitz (concept [no win32 setup])

  * r14536
    Make backend tests explicit and do them for both BDB and FSFS.
    Justification:
      Complete testing = good.

  * r14559
    Validate locks received from server in libsvn_ra_dav.
    Justification:
      Prevents API violation that could lead to crashing clients.
      A bug in RC2 triggers this.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, brane

  * r14569
    Fix ra_dav segfault when trying to 'svn rm URL' containing locks.
    Justification:
      Trivial segfault fix; don't pass a NULL pointer to a function
      expecting an apr_hash_t.
    Votes:
      +1: sussman, brane

  * r14580
    Suppress GUI pop-ups from the Windows crypto provider when trying to
    decrypt passwords with an invalid key.
    Justification:
      Trivial change, removes an annoying (and useless) pop-up window.
    Votes:
      +1: brane

  * r14583
    Docstring fixes for the notification API revision.
    Justification:
      Just comment tweaks, fixing our API docs.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, brane

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r14521
    Make commit unlock files in subdirectories in svnserve.
    Justification:
      Causes commit to not unlock files, but remove locks from WC.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, brane, fitz

  * r14177, r14474, r14509
    Fix pool usage with --enable-dso.
    Justification: fixes some command line client crashes over ra_local
    Notes: r14177 is the svn_ra_initialize patch
    Votes:
      +1: philip, lundblad, fitz

  * r14552, r14553
    Fix revert to deal with svn:needs-lock property and read-only-ness.
    Justification:
      Revert does not restore read-only when needed.

      +1: djh, lundblad, brane
