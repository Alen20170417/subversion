This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Soak period:
  2005-11-30 - Begun with public announcement of rc4.
  2005-12-21 - Final week commences - critical backports only.
  2005-12-28 - Soak period elapsed!

Blocker:

  Wording specifically mentioning 'the plan for 1.3' is in the template
  post-lock and post-unlock hooks.  This would look ridiculous in a final
  1.3 release.

Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17365, r17377, r17379, r17403, r17405, r17487, r17494, r17508
    Clean autogenerated SWIG files when the user types "make clean" or
    "make clean-swig" and we are not in release mode.
    Justification:
      Without this fix, a user would have to type
        make extraclean
      to clean the autogenerated SWIG files.
    Branch: 1.3.x-clean-swig
    Notes:
      The core changes for this fix are included in r17405, r17494 and r17508.
      These revisions depend on several other changes: r17365, r17377, r17379,
      r17403, and r17487. These changes are described below.
      - Add "extraclean-swig" rule for cleaning all SWIG-related files when we
        are in release mode (r17403).
      - Clean libsvn_swig_perl directory in clean-swig-pl (r17379).
      - Simplify clean rule handling (r17377, r17403, r17487).
      - Check whether we are in a VPATH build by comparing $(abs_builddir) =
        $(abs_srcdir) (r17365).
      The 1.3.x-clean-swig branch includes all of the above changes, and
      solves a trivial merge conflict in r17405.
