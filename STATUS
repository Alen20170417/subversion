Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12075
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.
    Votes:
      +1: dionisos, ghudson

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

      Nominated by: David James <james82@gmail.com>

  * r12397
    Properly invoke ra_callbacks->open_tmp_file in Perl with pool.
    Justification:
      Sanitize perl bindings pool usage and avoid potential memory leak.
