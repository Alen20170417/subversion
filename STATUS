    Make the test suite in server-minor-version=4 mode pass
    against 1.4.x servers.
    Notes:
      r30443 conflicts trying to modify an svnadmin test which isn't in
      1.5.x; the proper resolution is to delete the whole conflict block
      from <<< to >>> (which looks like the addition of
      fsfs_recover_handle_missing_revs_or_revprops_file).
    How to test:
      1.5.x-checkout$ svnserve-1.4.x -d -r `pwd`/subversion/tests/cmdline &
      1.5.x-checkout$ make svncheck SERVER_MINOR_VERSION=4
