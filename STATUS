This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1479320, r1479321, r1479323, r1479326, r1479329
   Silence 'make -s clean distclean'.
   Justification:
     'make -s all install distclean' would spam stdout and issue irrelevant
     warnings on stderr.  (This is user-facing behaviour.)
   Votes:
     +1 (for 1.8.1): danielsh
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1479896
   Sort directory entries in output of 'svnlook tree'.
   Justification:
     Unstable APR hash order causes unstable output.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1480077
   Check separately for -flto and -Wno-clobbered with --enable-optimize.
   Justification:
     The -flto flag was not used by older compilers that do not
     suport -Wno-clobbered, even when they do support -flto.
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1480080, r1481772
   Instruct clang to not warn about unknown warning flags.
   Justification:
     Newer versions of clang accept warning flags that they do not
     support, but emit warnings about them instead -- making the
     compile output a mess with a warning emitted for every
     single C and C++ file in an optimized build (because
     of the -Wno-clobbered, see above).
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     +0: rhuijben (looks ok, but I can't test or verify via code inspection)

 * r1481594
   Speed up reporting and authz checks on copy-from info in 'svn log'.
   Justification:
     The way we implemented merges makes replacements and add-with-history
     a much more common occurance than they would otherwise be.  With this
     simple change, I've witnessed a ~25% speedup for e.g. the FreeBSD repo.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2 (for 1.8.1)
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1481596
   For 'svn log -g', eliminate read requests on directories and mergeinfo
   in revisions that are guaranteed to not change any mergeinfo.
   Justification:
     This simple change combined with r1481594 resulted in a 4x speedup for
     'svn log -g' in the FreeBSD repo with cold and 15x with hot caches.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2 (for 1.8.1)
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1481981
   Don't destroy localised strings in .prej files by converting them to ASCII.
   Justification:
     The .prej files are unreadable.
   Votes:
     +1: mattiase (non-binding), stsp, rhuijben

 * r1480149
   Fix a build problem on OS X 10.5.
   Justification:
     Necessary for building on PPC Macs.
   Votes:
     +1: mattiase (non-binding)
     +1: rhuijben (but I would prefer a cleaner fix for 1.9+)

 * r1477876, r1477891, r1478001, r1479605
   Fix a bug whereby a property conflict description always reported
     'unknown' for the node kind. Add a test which catches that bug.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1477876
   Notes:
     The fix is in r1477876, and the branch was needed to resolve conflicts
     (rather than porting prior changes on which it depended). The test is
     in r1478001, and it depends on the test file changes made in r1477891.
     r1479605 fixes an interactive conflict resolution bug triggered by this
     change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: blair (who has nominated brane's commits after his veto was
                added.  @philip: what do you mean wrong value?)
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     -0: philip (on r1469519, r1469520, no vote on r1481848, 1481870;
                 see dev thread: it's a false alarm, wrong value)
     -0: rhuijben (merge conflict in configure.ac in r1481848)

# 1.8.0-rc1 is being voted on currently and as such 1.8.0 is in the soak phase.
# Changes that are not intended for 1.8.0 should not be placed here and changes
# that would restart the soak should not be added unless they are resolving
# blocking issues.  If in doubt see this link for details:
