This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1480080, r1481772, r1481847
   Instruct clang to not warn about unknown warning flags.
   Justification:
     Newer versions of clang accept warning flags that they do not
     support, but emit warnings about them instead -- making the
     compile output a mess with a warning emitted for every
     single C and C++ file in an optimized build (because
     of the -Wno-clobbered, see above).
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     +1: danielsh
     +0: rhuijben (looks ok, but I can't test or verify via code inspection)

 * r1477876, r1477891, r1478001, r1479605
   Fix a bug whereby a property conflict description always reported
     'unknown' for the node kind. Add a test which catches that bug.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1477876
   Notes:
     The fix is in r1477876, and the branch was needed to resolve conflicts
     (rather than porting prior changes on which it depended). The test is
     in r1478001, and it depends on the test file changes made in r1477891.
     r1479605 fixes an interactive conflict resolution bug triggered by this
     change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, stsp

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)
     -0: rhuijben, breser (merge conflict in configure.ac in r1481848
                           <danielsh> resolved on the branch)

 * r1480344, r1480412, r1480442, r1480738, r1480765, r1482479, r1482524,
   r1482528, r1482536
   Fix Ruby binding tests on Windows and support Ruby 1.9[1].
   Justification:
     Running the test suite is important for, you know, testing.
   Notes:
     Bindings changes, so can go into 1.8.0.  [1] Ruby 1.9 doesn't quite
     yet work on Windows, but this gets us part way there, so there is no
     compelling reason not to include with this bunch.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba
     -0: danielsh (very close to +0; see dev@)

 * r1483575, r1483580, r1485018
   Define SVN_UNALIGNED_ACCESS_IS_OK for PowerPC.
   Justification:
     Performance for free.
   Votes:
     +1: mattiase (non-binding, not including r1485018)
     +1: breser, stefan2

 * r1485127
   Revert 1.8 behavior change that breaks some url forms when passed to
   ra_local. Without this some existing working copies using non standard
   urls to access the repository might be broken.
   Justification:
     Restores functionality that was lost in 1.8 compared to 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (for 1.8.1 or soak restart)
     +0: danielsh (looks right, but all this does is cause sess->repos_url
                   to be set to a non-canonical value; I wonder if the right
                   fix is to add a canonicalize() call in front of a strcmp()
                   in libsvn_client)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved for 1.8.1 or if soak is restarted for 1.8.0:
====================================================

Approved changes:
=================

# 1.8.0-rc2 is being voted on currently and as such 1.8.0 is in the soak phase.
# Changes that are not intended for 1.8.0 should not be placed here and changes
# that would restart the soak should not be added unless they are resolving
# blocking issues.  If in doubt see this link for details:
# http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization

 * r1483781
   Fix FSFS repository corruption on power or network disk failure on Windows:
   http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2013-05/0245.shtml
   Justification:
     Repository corruption. Regression from 1.6.x
   Votes:
     +1: ivan, blair, danielsh

 * r1482436
   Resolve regression in svn_ra_replay_range() where it didn't apply
   the send_changes FALSE flag to property changes.
   Justification:
     The replay without changes mode is used by repository viewers
     to obtain more information about changes. We should keep this
     behavior stable
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (for either 1.8.0 or later)
     +1: cmpilato, danielsh

 * r1480149
   Fix a build problem on OS X 10.5.
   Justification:
     Necessary for building on PPC Macs.
   Votes:
     +1: mattiase (non-binding)
     +1: rhuijben, breser, stefan2

 * r1485447, r1485449
   Make 'SQLITE_VERSION=3.7.15.1 ./get-deps.sh' work.
   Justification:
     Allow downloading another version without editing the script, for example
     if upstream break the URL to the tarball after a newer version has been
     released.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, cmpilato, stefan2
