Status of 1.0.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r8867, r8868, r8902
    Trivial performance fix for mod_authz_svn; cache the access file per
    connection instead of reloading it per request.
    Justification: Saves at least 2 loads of the access file per update, plus
    an additional number of times equal to the number of entries in the REPORT
    response.
    Notes: Similar code has been present in mod_dav_svn to cache an open
    filesystem per connection.

      -0: kfogel  (Reviewed the change; it's not *so* trivial, and I'm
                   not sure an optimization like this belongs in a
                   patch release.)

  * r9439, 9808
    Update many references to neon 0.24.6.
    Justification: 0.24.6 has a security issue.  See
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0398
    Notes: Make tweaks to spec files to have 1.0.4 in the changelogs when
    merging.
