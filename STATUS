Candidate changes for 1.5.4:
============================

 * r30257, r33024, r33026
   Don't try to filter natural history from added mergeinfo during
   reverse merges.
   Notes:
     r30257 is the urelated removal of an unused private struct in merge.c,
     not required but avoids a conflict with r33024.  r33024 is a change to
     include more information in the merge command baton, it results in no
     functional change itself but r33026 relies on this new information.
     There's a single trailing whitespace conflict during merge of r33024.
     r33026 is the core change.
   Justification:
     A reverse merge should simply return mergeinfo to a previous
     representation -- see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?listName=dev&msgNo=142777.
     This change also improves reverse merge performance as it eliminates
     some unnecessary communication with the repository.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r33693, r33704
   Fix merge bug introduced in the backport of the r29969, r32463, r33013,
   r33016, r33022, r33112 group in 1.5.3.
   Notes:
     There is a minor whitespace conflict in merge.c.
   Justification:
     This bug is a regression in 1.5.3, breaks mergeinfo aware merges when
     ecountered, and has already been seen a couple times in our own repos,
     see http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&&msgNo=144187
     and http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3294#desc1.
