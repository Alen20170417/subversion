This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r17139
   svnmerge.py: Fix traceback on wrong command line.
   Justification:
     While it is not critical, two stupid bugs can cause tracebacks
     instead of nice error messages on wrong command lines.
   Note:
     The fix is pretty safe, and contains a new set of exhaustive
     tests to make sure nothing else is broken about command line
     handling.

 * r17214
   Fix crash because of reentrant call to javahl and close race condition
   window.
   Justification:
     Fixes JVM crash in Subclipse when it attempts to call
     is/getAdminDirectory() or cancelOperation() while another operation
     is running.
   Notes:
     markphip:
     I applied this patch to 1.3.x branch and verified it fixes problems in
     Subclipse.

 * r17279
   Don't use recursive symbolic links in our build tree.

     as scp and python.
