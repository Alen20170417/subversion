   Workaround for issue #4087, "bogus repos_id in wc.db for file externals"

   Branch:

 * r1291797, r1291810
   On Windows detect where perl is installed and add this information to the
   include and lib directory settings of the swig-perl projects.
   Justification:
     Allows building swig-perl without copying perl libraries manually.
     Somehow required on the Windows buildbot since the last library version
     bump.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: pburba (I can't replicate the build problem, I can build with or
                 without the patch).

 * r1293945, r1293972, r1293976, r1293998, r1294136, r1294236;
   r1294134, r1294147, r1294586
   Two interdependent changes:
   Fix issue #4121: copy followed by delete of unreadable child.
   Fix svn:// authz in Python tests.
   Justification:
     User resorted to patching the commit editor to work around this.
     Tests are broken.
   Notes:
     r1293945,r1293972,r1293976 are cosmetics.
     r1293998 is the fix.
     r1294136 is a test.
     r1294236 fixes an uninitialized variable.
   Notes:
     r1294134 extends a test to demonstrate its brokenness.
     r1294147 fixes said brokenness.
     r1294586 fixes r1294147 for Windows.
