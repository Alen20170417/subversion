Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1818577, r1819146
   Fix test suite handling of pre-cooked repositories 
   Justification:
     We want our test suite to pass with fsfs-v4 repos as it did in 1.9.
     As a bonus, it will also work with fsfs-v3 now.

 * r1819036, r1819043
   Switch 'svn ls --search' on Windows to sub-string matching.
   Justification:
     The new feature was mostly unusable on the Windows CLI.  With this
     CLI-only work-around, it becomes worthwhile again.

 * r1818584
   Fix crash when exiting 'svnserve --config-file'.
   Justification:
     This is a user-reported crash. The underlying container type is now also
     part of the authz infrastructure and should be as robust as possible.

 * r1819804
   Fix 'shelve' when the current working directory is not the WC root.
   Justification:
     Makes shelve follow typical UI of svn commands

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1819444
   autogen.sh: Correct the symbolic error name generation logic under Python 3.
   Justification:
     Fixes a false positive warning in autogen.sh under Python 3.  Trivial fix.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, jamessan, stefan2

 * r1819556, r1819557
   Improve external command invocation in the swig parts of the build system.
   Both gen-make.py and 'make swig-py' are affected.
   Justification:
     More robust build system (e.g., error checking in the __init__.py
     callers).
