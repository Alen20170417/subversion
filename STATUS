Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since that is nominated
     separately.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * fs-progress branch
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1146131 group (1.7.x-fs-verify).
   Branch:
     fs-progress
   Justification:
     Provide feedback during 'svnadmin verify'.
     Avoid an API change in 1.8.
   Notes:
     If this proposal passes, the docstrings @since would have to be fixed
     in a new commit.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh

 * r1147882
   Convert (pre-lock hook)-specified lock tokens to UTF-8.
   Justification:
     (zhakov, please fill in)
   Votes:
     -0: danielsh (pending clarification whether it's a mod_dav_svn bug,
                   libsvn_repos/libsvn_fs token validation bug, or both;
                   see dev@)

 * r1148424
   Resolve issue 3963, 'svn update -r{R>HEAD}' hangs client over ra_svn.
   Justification:
     Subversion and svnserve shouldn't hang waiting for IO that will
     never come when a user passes a revision that hasn't been committed
     yet.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * 1.7.x-neon-default branch
   Make neon the default http library.
   Justification:
     Serf isn't ready, new code not enabled, no proposal to enable it.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -1: gstein (I see no explanation for why "serf is not ready")

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r1148083, r1148094
   Preload libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring and libsvn_auth_kwallet in locally built
   executables.
   Justification:
     Version mismatch errors would occur during trying to use locally built
     executables when a different version of Subversion was installed in /usr/lib.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r1148992
   Print error messages about failures of dynamic loading of libraries when
   SVN_DEBUG_DSO is defined instead of never.
   Justification:
     Suboptimal r1148374 was already backported in r1148488.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r1149160
   Make serf report an error when performing 'svn log' on a non existing path
   aka issue #3937.
   Justifications:
     There should be no known regressions in the default http ra layer.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1149240
   Support APR 0.9.
   Justification:
     We still claim to support it.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1148877,r1148882,r1149105,r1149141, r1149228
   Issue 3966, log_noop_revs too slow.
   Justification:
     Merge is far too slow when lots of revisions have to be checked.
   Notes:
     r1148877 is pool cleanup
     r1148882 is docstring cleanup
     r1149105 is the actual fix
     r1149141 is more pool cleanup
     r1149228 is a fix for r1149105
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +1: hwright, rhuijben (all but r1149228)
     -1: pburba (r1149105 is wrong, see
         http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2011-07/0645.shtml
         Change my vote to +1 if r1149228 is also included in this group)
