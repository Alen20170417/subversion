This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520
   Silence compiler warnings.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     -0: philip (see dev thread: it's a false alarm, wrong value)
     -0.5: brane (silencing warnings is not a valid reason for a backport,
                  even for branch stabilization.)

 * r1470246
   Improve the interactive resolution of property conflicts.  Instead of
   showing the contents of the '.prej' file once for each prop conflict, show
   initially a single line such as
     "local delete, incoming edit upon merge"
   (similar to resolving a text conflict) and allow the user to display a 3-way
   diff by adding a 'dc - display conflict' option.
   Justification:
     Showing the whole .prej file each time was confusing and ugly when more
     than one property was in conflict.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1471443, r1471490
   Fix a bug in the Summary of Conflicts when using interactive conflict
     resolution.  Marking a text conflict as resolved but leaving a prop
     conflict unresolved on the same file, or vice versa, would decrement
     both the text and prop conflict summary stats.
   Justification:
     Regression since 1.7.
   Notes:
     r1471443 is just a removal of unused code, and is included here in
     order to avoid conflicts.  r1471490 is the main change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, brane

 * r1469363, r1469645, r1469674, r1470037, r1470537, r1478220, r1478221,
   r1478465
   Fix issue #4355 'svn_client_log5 broken with multiple revisions which
   span a rename'.
   Justification:
     svn_client_log5 doesn't deliver what it promises, see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4355#desc1 for
     a brief example of the problem.
   Notes:
     r1469363, r1469645, r1469674, r1470037, and r1470537 are the creation
     and subsequent tweaks of a single new log test for this issue.  r1478220
     is the fix.  r1478221 and r1478465 are a minor follow-ups to that fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1477876, r1477891, r1478001
   Fix a bug whereby a property conflict description always reported
     'unknown' for the node kind. Add a test which catches that bug.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1477876
   Notes:
     The fix is in r1477876, and the branch was needed to resolve conflicts
     (rather than porting prior changes on which it depended). The test is
     in r1478001, and it depends on the test file changes made in r1477891.
   Votes:
     -1: julianfoad ('svn update' now crashes on interactive resolution of a
                     prop conflict)
