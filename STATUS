Status of 1.3.0:
================

Soak period:
  2005-11-30 - Begun with public announcement of rc4.
  2005-12-21 - Final week commences - critical backports only.
  2005-12-28 - Soak period elapsed!

Candidate changes:

  * r17844
    Fix a bug in the assignment of out of date info to svn_wc_status2_t string
    members.  This problem has only been found with url, but it appears just as
    likely to affect ood_last_cmt_author.
    Justification:
      Without this change, the url and ood_last_cmt_author members of
      svn_wc_status2_t can be corrupted for out of date working copy items.

  * r17851
    Remove wording about 'the plan for 1.3' from the template post-lock and
    post-unlock hook scripts.
    Justification:
      Trivial change, and maxb says the current text looks ridiculous.

Approved changes:

  * r17870
    Improve Ruby bindings memory management by supporting subpool. This change
    solves a program which uses Ruby bindings grows fat because making subpool
    each svn function call causes Ruby's GC at high frequency.
    Justification:
      Without this change, a program which uses Ruby bindings grows over a
      hundred MB easily. Here is a problem case:
