Status of 1.8.12:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: ivan, brane (not regression from 1.7.x,
                      destructive change in libsvn_wc core)
     -0: rhuijben (temporarily remove my +1 until I complete investigating
                   a related problem. It looks like this fix doesn't work for
                   the user scenario it was intended for)

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser

 * r1590751
   Use empty, rather than NULL, config if default is unreadable.
   Justification:
     svn SEGV reported by user.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -0: julianfoad (prefer to fix all the programs at the same time;
                     other queries -- see email thread)

 * r1561419, r1561427, 1547489, r1560643, r1573744
   Fix the hotcopy and recovery for pre-1.4 FSFS repositories.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1573744-and-friends
   Justification:
     Without this, old SVN versions won't be able to e.g. hotcopy those
     repos once 1.8.x made a commit in them.  Also, fix our hotcopy code
     and make it cope with repositories broken by previous 1.8.x releases.
   Notes:
     The best way to review this is to review the backporting result in
     r1640603 instead of inspecting the original patches.
     "r1573744" is a bit of a misnomer as only the test case got backported
     because the workflow problem fixed by it does not exist in 1.8.x.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1619380, r1619393
   Fix diff of a locally copied directory with props: it showed all props
   as added instead of a diff against the copy-from props.
   Justification:
     Behaviour regression introduced in 1.8.0.
   Notes:
     r1619380 is the fix; r1619393 a test for it.
     The test on trunk@1619393 is tweaked to account for a trunk bug in the
     display of diff headers; the backport branch provides the correct
     version for 1.8.x.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1619380
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: julianfoad (previously said +1 with the wrong branch mentioned)
     +0: stefan2 (previously said +1 with the wrong branch mentioned)

 * r1644158, r1644530, r1644595, r1644599, r1652744
   Fix patch output for reordered hunks, part of issue 4533.
   Justification:
     Output is invalid, hunks replace the wrong bits of the file.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1644595
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1646785, r1646786, r1646797
   Fix a pool handling bug in config variable expansion.
   Justification:
     Using memory after free is undefined behaviour.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1646797
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1650531
   Fix a redirect handling bug in 'svn log' over HTTP. 
   Justification:
     Redirects should work.
   Notes:
     Merge with --accept tc
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1651963, r1651966, r1651980, r1651997
   Sequence of moves shouldn't trigger an assertion in the working copy
   Justification:
     Users shouldn't be able to trigger assertions by performing normal
     operations.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1513479, r1625522 
   Fix issue #4411, 'parent-relative file external can corrupt working copy'.
   Justification:
     Broken working copies are bad.
   Notes:
     This also adds a test case for issue #4519 which was fixed in 1.8.11.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4411
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1654932, r1654933, r1654934, r1654937
   Fix issue #4554, "0 file length reported in FSFS".
   Justification:
     This causes 'svnadmin dump' to create corrupted output that fails to
     load and we provide no way to detect that problem other than loading
     the respective dump.  We also want to prevent further instances of
     that issue to be added to the repository.
   Notes:
     r1561419 has been removed from this change set and proposed for a
     separate backport because it is not a necessary part of the #4554 fix.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4554
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +0: rhuijben (patch looks sane, but hard to oversee consequences)

 * r1658115, r1659553, r1659554
   Stop dropping a value when copying tree conflict information
   Justification:
     Trivial correctness fix that provides valueable information to the
     conflict resolver.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1658417
   Don't ask a resolver if we should resolve if we only take no as answer
   Justification:
     Presenting conflicts to the conflict resolver only makes sense if the
     result of the function is potentially applied. I'm surprised that
     nobody noticed this problem in svn_wc_resolved_conflict5().
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -1: breser (see my email to dev@, <5282FE15.40505@reser.org>)

 * r1652182, r1652195, r1652200, r1653622, r1653623, r1653988, r1654039, r1654162, r1654186, r1654271
   Fix issue #4551 "svnrdump load commits wrong properties, or fails, on a
   non-deltas dumpfile".
   Justification:
     Data loss.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4551
   Notes:
     r1653988, r1654039, r1654271 contain the fixes; the rest are adding tests.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben
     -1: philip (uses apr_hash_key this without the neccessary backport support)

 * r1646230, r1646250, r1646253, r1656893, r1657182, r1657195, r1657401
   Make svnsync strip any r0 references from mergeinfo -- issue #4476.
   Justification:
     Without this is was not possible to svnsync a repository that contained
     this kind of mergeinfo that is now considered invalid but previously
     could be committed.
   Notes:
     r1643074 (nominated separately) is required for the test to work.
     I would recommend not backporting r1646250 without r1643074.
     This is also nominated for 1.7.x. The regression test in this group
     depends on the issue #4538 fix in r1646505.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad
     -1: philip (new test is a FAIL, needs a fix for issue 4538)

 * r1646495, r1646505
   Fix issue #4538 'svnadmin load' strips r1 references in mergeinfo
   Justification:
     Fixes a design problem for an uncommon case that is exposed in the
     testcases for issue #4476.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1646505
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1659013, r1659315
   Fix a race in the DSO initialisation code.
   Justification:
     Fixes occasional SEGV when multiple threads load DSOs in parallel.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben, ivan

 * r1651759
   Api correctness fix: Duplicate error filename when copying errors
   Justification:
     Simple to fix issue caused error on buildbot.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan, philip

 * r1659399
   Make the SQLite build with recent (3.8.x?) amalgamated versions.
   Justification:
     It's a trivial change to catch up with upstream arbitrariness,
     and there's no reason to support a different set of amalgamated
     SQLite versions than library versions.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, ivan, philip, rhuijben

 * r1656713
   Fix reporting errors from ra_svn's svn_ra_get_dir2() in some cases.
   Justification:
     Causes a connection stall in custom repository browsers that get
     into this code path by not verifying if the directory exists before
     calling this function. Regression against <= 1.7.x.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan, philip

 * r1596882
   Fix build with Ruby 2.
   Justification:
     Move along with the times! And should fix buildbot failures
     according to jamessan, who submitted the patch.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben, philip

 * r1643074
   Don't let invalid mergeinfo stop 'svnadmin load' from working.
     Part of issue #4476 "Mergeinfo containing r0 makes svnsync and svnadmin
     dump fail".
   Justification:
     The presence of 'bad' metadata in a repository should not prevent
     backing up and restoring from a backup, given that this data does not
     make the repository totally unusable.
   Notes:
     The 'svnadmin dump' part of this issue was already backported in v1.8.9.
     The 'svnsync' part of this issue is not yet fixed.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1643074

     +1: julianfoad, philip, rhuijben
