Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)

 * r1705038
   Fix issue 4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1762338, r1762339, r1769973
   Fix issue #4655: add zlib discovery through pkg-config.
   Justification:
     Allows building Subversion with non-default zlib layouts, such as
     with libraries in $zlib_prefix/lib/hpux32 on HP-UX.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +1: kotkov (without r1769973)
     +0: rhuijben (patch looks good. Untested) (+1 for r1769973)

 * r1759117, r1759122, r1759123, r1759124, 1764676
   Fix issue #4657: "Offset too large" error when packing repository in
   FSFS 7 format.
   Justification:
     Problem occurred in at least two user repositories.  Without the fix,
     format 7 repositories with an exceptionally large number of changes in
     a pack cannot be packed - which renders using f7 pointless for those
     users.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-fsfs-pack-fixes@r1764683
   Notes:
     r1759117-23 provide the actual fixes.
     r1759124 adds a regression test with the necessary internal API changes.
     r1764676 eliminates our reliance on the currently broken APR trunc().
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +1: stsp (There is a no-op whitespace change in the file
               subversion/tests/libsvn_subr/io-test.c -- would be
               nice to get rid of that before merging the branch)
     -0: rhuijben (Merging this branch now introduces conflicts. Caused
                   by the 2016-11-17 merges)

 * r1766699, r1766704, r1766711
   Fix a bug where reintegrate merges access a non-existent path and error out.
   Justification:
     This problem can prevent reintegration of branches in some situations.
     Advanced users can fall back to a 2-URL merge but most users won't
     realize how they can work around the problem.

     +1: stsp
