This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.5:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1498000
   Improve error handling for inherited property requests by using the
   transition based xml parser in libsvn_ra_serf.
   Justification:
     This maintenance work which usually doesn't belong in a patch release
     makes it possible to properly detect if this request should be restarted
     on non-chunk-enabled proxies.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1496127
   Fix occasional failure of checkout_tests.py 12.
   Justification:
     Spurious FAILs confuse people testing the release.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     -0: danielsh (loses functionality; patch sent with alternative fix)
     stsp: where exactly is the alternative patch?
     danielsh: http://mid.gmane.org/20130705040533.GL3244@lp-shahaf.local

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben
     -0: ivan (not regression from 1.7.x, destructive change in libsvn_wc core)

 * r1501656, r1501702
   Fix the ability to build Debug Build with BDB FS on Windows.
   Justification:
     Our build system should work properly.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Not a regression and I don't think we should encourage
                   building with just a debug BDB (even for release mode)
                   by backporting this change. That would require using the
                   non-distributable debug CRT. Trunk has a cleaner
                   detection of BDB (via db.h) and even while debugging a
                   maintainer build of Subversion a release BDB works fine)

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1534149
   In the windows CryptoAPI ssl certificate verification, properly handle
   certificates that are only trusted via intermediate authorities.
   Justification:
      While not strictly a bug, intermediate authorities are getting more
      common since recent Certificate Authority incidents.
   Notes:
      rhuijben: This introduces a new credential type as private API.
      Not sure about our strict ABI guarantees here, but this affects
      usability of users migrating to cloud platforms, etc.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1533530
   Fix latency issue when reusing svnserve connections.
   Justification:
      This simple patch affects all operations that run multiple requests
      over the same connection.  It should improve things like e.g. merge.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1499470
   Flush stdout before exiting svn with an error.
   Justification:
      Without this patch merge_tests.py 135 may fail to output its required
      output.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1535115
   Make JavaHL tests run without installing on OS X.
   Justification:
     Shouldn't need to install code to test it.
   Votes:
     +1: breser

 * r1535139
   Make openssl lib and include directory available when using --with-openssl
   on Windows.
   Justification:
     Serf 1.2 simply included the openssl static library in its own static
     library, which made it very easy for Subversion to consume, but added the
     risk of linking to many different openssl versions (both static and
     shared builds) at once. This bug in serf was fixed for 1.3 and we
     updated Subversion to use 1.3 for Subversion 1.8.4, but without this
     patch we added the assumption that ssleay32.lib and libeay32.lib are
     within some existing referenced library directory.
     This patch fixes that assumption by adding the right libdir to our build,
     by borrowing some code from trunk.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-openssl-dirs
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1535161
   Make swig-rb tests run without installing on OS X.
   Justification:
     Shouldn't need to install code to test it.  The existing Makefile target
     is just downright wrong.
   Votes:
     +1: breser
