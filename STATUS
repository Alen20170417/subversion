Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17365, r17377, r17379, r17403, r17405, r17487, r17494
    Clean autogenerated SWIG files when the user types "make clean" or
    "make clean-swig" and we are not in release mode (r17405, r17494).
    Justification:
      Without this fix, a user would have to type
        make extraclean
      to clean the autogenerated SWIG files.
    Branch: 1.3.x-clean-swig
    Notes:
      The core changes for this fix are included in r17405 and r17494. These
      revisions depend on several other changes: r17365, r17377, r17379,
      r17403, and r17487. These changes are described below.
      - Add "extraclean-swig" rule for cleaning all SWIG-related files when we
        are in release mode (r17403).
      - Clean libsvn_swig_perl directory in clean-swig-pl (r17379).
      - Simplify clean rule handling (r17377, r17403, r17487).
      The 1.3.x-clean-swig branch solves a trivial conflict in r17405.
