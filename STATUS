Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14024
    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.
    Justification:
      Encourages hacking on the bindings, and improves user confidence.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, fitz (concept)

  * r14041, r14149, r14186, r14194, r14238, r14273
    Fix issue #2268 (svn update of xml-unsafe dir (from within) http error)
    and similar problems regarding paths with leading or trailing spaces.
    Justification:
      Yet Another Path Escaping Bug
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, cmpilato (and could this get drawn out ANY longer?)

  * r14205, 14208
    Add lock/unlock support to mailer.py.
    Justification:
      Necessary feature... besides, who doesn't want more email?
    Votes:
      +1: fitz, dlr

  * r14259
    Fix #2262, including making lock expiration work in FSFS on recursive
    operations.
    Justification:
      Expired locks shouldn't be visible any more.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, fitz

  * r14262
    Fix #2049, make autoversioning cooperate with mod_mime.
    Justification:
      svn 1.2 brags about autoversioning being 'finished', but it's
      really unfriendly when (for example) a Word file is dragged to a
      share, but doesn't get re-fetched as a Word file.  Without that,
      autoversioning is a non-starter for many.

  * r14274
    Enable lock_tests.py No. 8 (defunct_lock) on Windows.
    Justification:
      It works just fine, more tests are better.
    Votes:
      +1: brane, sussman, dlr (concept)

   * r14277
     Make Subversion easier to build "out-of-the-box" on WBEL3/RHEL3 by
       dropping support for BDB.
     Justification:
       Trying to integrate BDB 4.2.x in to WBEL3/RHEL3 was too problematic.
       This makes things much easier.  Later I will try again to build a good
       BDB 4.2.X build that doesn't conflict with the standard 4.1.25 that
       comes with the distribution.

  * r14216
    Perl bindings: Don't leak editor objects on failed editor calls.
    Justification:
      Failed editor calls for editor driver would cause the whole editor
      object to leak, by holding unnecessary refcnt.  Those objects are
      usually quite large in svk.
    Votes:
     +1: clkao

  * r14280
    Build ZLib from sources on Windows.
    Justification:
      Cures major PITA for Windows developers, improves debugging support.
    Concerns:
      Not exactly a showstopper for 1.2.0.
    Votes:
      +0.9: brane (+1 for 1.2.1)

  * r14286
    Make "make davautocheck" work for locking and work out-of-the-box
    on more systems.
    Justification:
      Makes it easier to test over DAV; not a core code change.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad

  * r14295
    Fix memory problem with neon lock hook.
    Justification:
      This problem can cause the client to crash in libsvn_ra_dav.
    Votes:
      +1: philip, brane

  * r14304, 14306
    Fix issue #2278: svn:needs-lock property interferes
                     with update on Windows
    Justification:
      Makes locking actually useable on Windows. 1.2 showstopper.
    Notes: I will change my +0 to a +1 when I get into the office
           Wednesday 2004/04/20 and can test this on a Windows box.
           As far as the code change goes, I'm +1 now.  -kfogel
