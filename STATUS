Status of 1.8.12:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.

     +1: stefan2, breser
     -0: julianfoad (test is missing from branch -- how do we know it works?)

 * r1654932, r1654933, r1654934, r1654937
   Fix issue #4554, "0 file length reported in FSFS".
   Justification:
     This causes 'svnadmin dump' to create corrupted output that fails to
     load and we provide no way to detect that problem other than loading
     the respective dump.  We also want to prevent further instances of
     that issue to be added to the repository.
   Notes:
     r1561419 has been removed from this change set and proposed for a
     separate backport because it is not a necessary part of the #4554 fix.

   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +0: rhuijben (patch looks sane, but hard to oversee consequences)
     +0: danielsh (hard to review all potential causes of expanded_size==0 in
                   7*3*2 cases (1.1…1.8) × (file/dir/prop rep) × (plain/delta))

 * r1666965, r1667120
   Reduce 'the lag' of the first svn log results over mod_dav.
   Justification:
     A slow svn log makes users call Subversion slow. This fixes the
     perceived performance problem by no longer optimizing just for
     obtaining all the results fast, but also for obtaining the first
     result fast.
     .
     Just the perceived slowness of common svn log operations might
     make users switch to a DVCS or implement a client side cache,
     while this slowness is just a buffering to make the total set of
     results come in faster. But I don't think there are that many users
     that really wait for all results of
     .
     $ svn log -q ^/subversion/trunk
     .
     This currently takes > 10 seconds before the first result using
     the EU mirror for me. With --limit 1 (best comparison with post-patch)
     that would be 0.2 seconds.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip (After it has been approved for 1.9)
     -0.5: ivan (It's not security or bug fix. The change itself a little
                 bit controversial for me, so it's better to release it as
                 part of Subversion 1.9.0)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1532287
   Simplify Windows resource compilation to avoid warnings
   Justification:
     Windows .rc files are compiled with a resource compiler that uses a
     C preprocessor. Our .rc file uses svn_version.h to include the version
     info, but this also brings in a lot of other include files. On newer
     Windows development platforms these header files include macros that
     cause warnings in the resource compilation process. This patch resolves
     all those warnings by including just what is necessary. (This resolves
     multiple warnings for each .dll and .exe on the Windows buildbot,
     thereby hiding more important warnings)

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1660593
   Fix recording last-* information on nodes copied from foreign repositories
   Justification:
     Recording revisions (and other details) of foreign repositories causes
     incorrect status output and bugs when using -rCOMMITTED, -rPREV, etc.
     Local fix.
   Notes:
     The backport includes a small consistency fix from trunk.

 * r1660646
   Fix calculating the repository path of replaced directories on entry upgrade
   Justification:
     Simple fix that avoids recording invalid data in WC-NG.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp, brane

 * r1663991
   Fix calculating the repository path after commits of nodes that are
   shadowing a switched (not-present) node.
   Justification:
     Allows introducing repository paths in the working copy, that don't
     reflect the repository state.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp, brane

 * r1664684
   svnrdump: don't provide HEAD+1 as base revision when loading deletes.
   Justification:
     Our own tools should be well behaved.
   Notes:
     A trival merge conflict is fixed on the branch.

 * r1660220, r1665874
   Don't leave conflict markers on files that are moved
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1660220
   Justification:
     Without this patch property or text conflicted files that are moved
     leave dangling conflict markers in the old location. Easy fix.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, brane, rhuijben

 * r1666690
   Record skipped tree during merge on the skip root instead of leaves
   Justification:
     Resolves a user reported problem in merge handling. Avoids unnecessary
     mergeinfo recording on multiple leaves when a single ancestor is shadowed.

 * r1619380, r1619393, r1660186
   Fix diff of a locally copied directory with props: it showed all props
   as added instead of a diff against the copy-from props.
   Justification:
     Behaviour regression introduced in 1.8.0.
   Notes:
     r1619380 is the fix; r1619393 a test for it.
     The test on trunk@1619393 is tweaked to account for a trunk bug in the
     display of diff headers; the backport branch provides the correct
     version for 1.8.x.
