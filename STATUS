Status of 1.8.12:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: ivan, brane (not regression from 1.7.x,
                      destructive change in libsvn_wc core)
     -0: rhuijben (temporarily remove my +1 until I complete investigating
                   a related problem. It looks like this fix doesn't work for
                   the user scenario it was intended for)

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser

 * r1590751
   Use empty, rather than NULL, config if default is unreadable.
   Justification:
     svn SEGV reported by user.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -0: julianfoad (prefer to fix all the programs at the same time;
                     other queries -- see email thread)

 * r1561419, r1561427, 1547489, r1560643, r1573744
   Fix the hotcopy and recovery for pre-1.4 FSFS repositories.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1573744-and-friends
   Justification:
     Without this, old SVN versions won't be able to e.g. hotcopy those
     repos once 1.8.x made a commit in them.  Also, fix our hotcopy code
     and make it cope with repositories broken by previous 1.8.x releases.
   Notes:
     The best way to review this is to review the backporting result in
     r1640603 instead of inspecting the original patches.
     "r1573744" is a bit of a misnomer as only the test case got backported
     because the workflow problem fixed by it does not exist in 1.8.x.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1619380, r1619393
   Fix diff of a locally copied directory with props: it showed all props
   as added instead of a diff against the copy-from props.
   Justification:
     Behaviour regression introduced in 1.8.0.
   Notes:
     r1619380 is the fix; r1619393 a test for it.
     The test on trunk@1619393 is tweaked to account for a trunk bug in the
     display of diff headers; the backport branch provides the correct
     version for 1.8.x.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1619380
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: julianfoad (previously said +1 with the wrong branch mentioned)
     +0: stefan2 (previously said +1 with the wrong branch mentioned)

 * r1643074
   Don't let invalid mergeinfo stop 'svnadmin load' from working.
     Part of issue #4476 "Mergeinfo containing r0 makes svnsync and svnadmin
     dump fail".
   Justification:
     The presence of 'bad' metadata in a repository should not prevent
     backing up and restoring from a backup, given that this data does not
     make the repository totally unusable.
   Notes:
     The 'svnadmin dump' part of this issue was already backported in v1.8.9.
     The 'svnsync' part of this issue is not yet fixed.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1643074
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1644158, r1644530, r1644595, r1644599, r1652744
   Fix patch output for reordered hunks, part of issue 4533.
   Justification:
     Output is invalid, hunks replace the wrong bits of the file.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1644595
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1646230, r1646250, r1646253
   Make svnsync strip any r0 references from mergeinfo -- issue #4476.
   Justification:
     Without this is was not possible to svnsync a repository that contained
     this kind of mergeinfo that is now considered invalid but previously
     could be committed.
   Notes:
     r1646250 contains the fix itself, and a test for it.
     r1646253 removes some stray debug statements.
     r1646230 is required for the test to work.
     r1643074 (nominated separately) is required for the test to work.
     I would recommend not backporting r1646250 without r1643074.
     This is also nominated for 1.7.x.

 * r1646785, r1646786, r1646797
   Fix a pool handling bug in config variable expansion.
   Justification:
     Using memory after free is undefined behaviour.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1646797
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1611380, r1611381, r1619071, r1647339
   Use simple apr_thread_mutex_t instead of apr_thread_rwlock_t as a workaround
   for performance and consistency problems in APR read/write locks
   implementation on Windows. The APR read/write locks implementation is
   currently known for two long standing problems:
   - Windows and OS/2 rwlock sometimes allows a writer to take the lock while
     a reader has the lock (APR issue 45455)
   - Read-write locks are very slow on Windows due usage of kernel-mode
     CreateMutex instead lightweight criticial section used for apr_mutex_t.
   Justification:
   - In memory cache data corruption in race-condition on Windows
   - 10-15% performance regression since 1.7.x   Discussion:
     Subject: FSFS caching and apr_thread_rwlock_t performance on Windows
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2014-12/0112.shtml
   Notes:
     r1611380 contains the fix itself.
     r1611381 and r1619071 are the follow-up commits to fix compilation errors.
     r1647339 fixes error leak introduced in r1611380.

 * r1650531
   Fix a redirect handling bug in 'svn log' over HTTP. 
   Justification:
     Redirects should work.
   Notes:
     Merge with --accept tc
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1596882
   Fix build with Ruby 2.
   Justification:
     Move along with the times! And should fix buildbot failures
     according to jamessan, who submitted the patch.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1650834
   Fix svn_stringbuf_insert and svn_stringbuf_replace when the source is
   within the target stringbuf and contains NUL bytes.
   Justification:
     Result will usually be undefined and the functions may segfault.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, rhuijben

 * r1651759
   Api correctness fix: Duplicate error filename when copying errors
   Justification:
     Simple to fix issue caused error on buildbot.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1651963, r1651966, r1651980, r1651997
   Sequence of moves shouldn't trigger an assertion in the working copy
   Justification:
     Users shouldn't be able to trigger assertions by performing normal
     operations.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1653039
   Allocate correct amount of memory for freeze arguments.
   Justiciation:
     Writing beyond allocated memory is undefined behaviour.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1652182, r1652195, r1652200, r1653622, r1653623, r1653988, r1654039, r1654162, r1654186, r1654271
   Fix issue #4551 "svnrdump load commits wrong properties, or fails, on a
   non-deltas dumpfile".
   Justification:
     Data loss.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4551
   Notes:
     r1653988, r1654039, r1654271 contain the fixes; the rest are adding tests.
   Votes:
     +1 julianfoad, rhuijben

 * r1513479, r1625522 
   Fix issue #4411, 'parent-relative file external can corrupt working copy'.
   Justification:
     Broken working copies are bad.
   Notes:
     This also adds a test case for issue #4519 which was fixed in 1.8.11.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4411
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
