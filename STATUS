Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel
      +0: dlr (concept, new to this area of the code)

  * r16784
    Fix segfault possibility (introduced by the new WC/repository
    state APIs in r16344), which exhibits itself when the "svn:author"
    property has been deleted or does not exist.
    http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2005-10/0819.shtml
    Justification:
      Crashes are bad.  This repository state is easily achievable
      using propdel, or a DAV server which does not require auth.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, rooneg


Approved changes:

  * r16725
    Enable running autogen.sh with Python <2.1, in which the scope of
    variables within lambda is restricted.
    Justification:
      Build failure due only to the scope issue of old Python is not good.
    Votes:
      +1: djames, rooneg, dlr
      +0: nori

  * r16754, r16772
    Create deep copy utility functions for svn_wc_external_item_t,
    svn_client_proplist_item_t, and svn_client_commit_item2_t.
    Justification:
      Needed to prevent pool-related scoping segfaults in the Ruby bindings.
    Votes:
      +1: djames, lundblad, rooneg
      +0: kou (r16754 only)

  * r16744
    Duplicate C object when converting to Ruby object.
    Justification:
      Prevent pool-related segfaults.
    Notes:
      Depends on r16754
    Votes:
      +1: kou, dlr
