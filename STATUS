Candidate changes for 1.5.2:
============================

 * r32409
   Fix an incompatibility with BSD make, which was introduced in r24293.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix. Fixes out-of-tree build of the bindings on BSD.
     Might help downstream packagers for these systems.

 * r32416, r32421
   Respect LDFLAGS in Perl bindings.
   Notes:
     Previously LDFLAGS were ignored (except for libsvn_swig_perl) even when
     the SWIG_LDFLAGS variable was set.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r32442
   Respect LDFLAGS in SWIG bindings without the requirement of the exporting
   of the SWIG_LDFLAGS variable.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r32491
   Fix test failures in non-English locale.

 * r32494, r32522, r32523
   Fix a bug where previous merges are incorrectly reversed leading to repeat
   merges and spurious conflicts.
   Notes:
     r32494 is just a doc string tweak that hopefully makes the real fix a
     easier to review, r32522 is a test for the bug, and r32523 is the real
     fix.  There is a trivial conflict on r32494 when adding the new merge
     test due to the fact that some other new merge tests are not backported
     yet.
   Justification:
     Repeat merges and needless conflicts in the age of merge tracking are,
     to put it mildly, less than desirable, see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=141832.

 * r32672, r32673, r32674
   Fix an inconsistency in parsing svn:externals with the new 1.5
   relative URL support when both a relative URL and a relative path
   is used with -r N.  Also, add stricter checking on svn:externals.
   Justification:
     If an 1.4 style external with -r N and an absolute URL is changed
     to use a relative URL, then svn will not parse the URL as a URL
     any more but as the target directory, which is odd and
     inconsistent behavior.  The code without this fix does not match
     the documentation on the web site.

  * r32703
    Fix a bug in the SWIG Python binding tests where test_create was
    creating a nested repository for the tests. As of r32648, this is
    no longer possible.
    Votes:
      +1: jwhitlock (non-binding)

 * r32643
   Improve merge performance by not driving the merge editor for ranges
   which don't need to be merged.
   Justification:
     After a year plus of making merge slower with merge tracking, making
     it a bit faster is a welcome change.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r32706, r32707
   Fix another issue #3067 bug where subtree mergeinfo can occur that
   breaks the merge editor drive.
   Notes:
     r32706 is a new test, r32707 is the fix.
   Justification:
     We've already encountered this problem in our own repository when
     trying to synch up the fs-rep-sharing branch with trunk (sorry no
     thread to reference, only discussed in IRC but the new test in r32706
     shows how it can happen).
