Status of 1.2.3:
================

  * r15419, r15420, r15422, r15448
    Add contrib/client-side/svn_apply_autoprops.py.
    Justification:
      It's a contrib script that is useful for users to easily apply
      their auto-props list to already checked in files across an
      entire working copy.  It would be good for it to be in an
      official release so that its more available.
