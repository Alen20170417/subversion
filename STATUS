Status of 1.10.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1818577, r1819146
   Fix test suite handling of pre-cooked repositories
   Justification:
     We want our test suite to pass with fsfs-v4 repos as it did in 1.9.
     As a bonus, it will also work with fsfs-v3 now.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1818584
   Fix crash when exiting 'svnserve --config-file'.
   Justification:
     This is a user-reported crash. The underlying container type is now also
     part of the authz infrastructure and should be as robust as possible.

 * r1819804
   Fix 'shelve' when the current working directory is not the WC root.
