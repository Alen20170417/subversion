Status of 1.7.9:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1306275, and other revisions
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-commit-performance
   r1337118, r1337281, r1337374, r1337377, r1337392, r1337394, r1337485
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
     [JAF] We might want to include some of the subsequent updates to this
           code, such as: r1337403, r1337475, r1337736, r1338059, r1338338.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1409804
   Add a delimiter between the two chains in svn_error_compose_create().
   Justification:
     Allow users to tell where the second error chain starts -- avoids
     misrepresentation that the first error is caused by the second.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (I'm not sure if this should be in a patch release and the
                   stacktrace where this refers to is maintainer only)
     +1: danielsh (err->file and err->line are only in maintainer builds.
                   this is about err->message which is valid in all builds)

 * r1421380
   Issue #4272: s/assertion/error/ in the DAV proxy code.
   Justification:
     The assertion has been run into in the wild
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben

 * r1421541, r1424977
   Fix infinite recursion in './get-deps.sh'.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix to plug an edge case.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (Is this needed on this branch?)
     +1: danielsh (as much as it's needed on trunk)

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4263
   Fix svnrdump inability to load dump files with non-LF line endings in
   'svn:*' properties.
   Justification:
     Other tools have had this issue resolved, svnrdump should as well.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4263
   Votes:
     +1: breser, danielsh

 * r1423837, r1423840, r1423848
   Fix issue #4168, "no such table: revert_list" for nested wc in sparse wc
   Justification:
     Accessing the wrong database from the revert code gives an ugly error
     which might not be easy to work around.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben   

 * r1425368
   Use the right api for generating the repository dirent in mod_dav_svn.
   Justification:
     Using dav_svn_get_repos_path() causes an assertion on Windows. This
     public api was unused until the in-repo-authz was merged to trunk.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1426752
   Fix Issue #4133, an issue in the diff-libraries whitespace normalization
   handling that might make diff use the wrong tokens, showing up as
   unexpected changes.
   Justification:
     The diff library should behave properly when suppressing whitespace
     changes.
   Notes:
     The branch is just needed for avoiding a conflict with the testcase.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1426752
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, jcorvel

 * r1426762
   Fix issue #4283, When the identical suffix starts at chunk boundary, "svn
   diff" produces incorrect diff.
   Justification:
     Without this patch the identical suffix might show up as an added or
     deleted suffix of a file.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, jcorvel

  * r1426830
    Resolve issue #3797, by making sure that local changes at the same path
    as a not present file are not skipped.
    Justification:
      Improves 'svn diff' handling of local changes.
    Votes:
      +1: rhuijben

  * r1352031
    Change get-deps.sh to use zlib 1.2.7.
    Justification:
      1.2.5 is no longer available for download at the URL get-deps.sh tries.
      This prevents get-deps.sh from failling.
    Notes:
      The branch is needed since get-deps.sh has removed neon on trunk which
      causes conflicts.
    Branch:
      ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1352031
    Votes:
      +1: breser, brane

 * r1427278
   Fix another issue in the diff-libraries whitespace normalization
   handling that might make diff show unexpected changes, and even trying
   to read beyond end of file.
   Justification:
     The diff library should behave properly when suppressing whitespace
     changes. See also http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-12/0556.shtml
     for some examples of this bug.
   Notes:
     The branch is just needed for avoiding a conflict with adding a comment.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1427278
   Votes:
     +1: jcorvel

 * r1427197, r1427210
   Fix issue #4270 'diff -cN shows wrong line changed'.  In the optimized
   code path (unaligned access) for prefix/suffix scanning, the diff would
   be incorrect when a '\r' is not immediately followed by a '\n'.
   Justification:
     Diff should show the correct changes. Failure to do so can lead to
     incorrect updates/merges (because diff3 suffers from the same bug).
