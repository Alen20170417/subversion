This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.0.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.0.0:
================

Release 1.0.0 is already frozen.  The candidate tarball was
subversion-0.37.0.tar.gz for a four week soak period; we'll put out
1.0.0-beta1 on Friday, February 20th as a final sanity check, then
release 1.0.0 on February 23rd, 2004.  If you find a bug that you
think is important enough to delay 1.0.0, please start a dev@ list
thread and mention the thread below.

  * r8253
    Make svnlook use apr_tempdir(), instead of trying to write in '.'

      +0: dlr, gstein

    Votes:
      +1: sussman, dlr, philip

      +0: dlr, gstein

    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, dlr, sussman
      -1: julianfoad (memory leak and inappropriate verbosity; see the dev@
            mailing list thread "r8616: candidate for 1.0.1: Improved warnings
            from svnlook and svnadmin")

  * r8581
    Detect invalid UTF8 filenames when native locale is UTF8.
    Justification:  it's really easy to get invalid utf8 into the repository,
                    which then hoses checkouts.
    Notes:  This has the potential to burn a whole lot of new users.
    Votes:

      -0: gstein  (woah. lots o' code)

  * r8672
    Fix svn_io_dir_walk 'dot-first' ordering required by 'svnadmin hotcopy'
    Justification: 'svnadmin hotcopy' can fail on ext3/Linux-2.6 (and XFS?)
    Votes:
      +1: philip
      +0: gstein  (feels big; need more review)
