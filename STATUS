Status of 1.7.9:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-commit-performance
   r1337118, r1337281, r1337374, r1337377, r1337392, r1337394, r1337485
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
     [JAF] We might want to include some of the subsequent updates to this
           code, such as: r1337403, r1337475, r1337736, r1338059, r1338338.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1409804
   Add a delimiter between the two chains in svn_error_compose_create().
   Justification:
     Allow users to tell where the second error chain starts -- avoids
     misrepresentation that the first error is caused by the second.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     -0: rhuijben (I'm not sure if this should be in a patch release and the
                   stacktrace where this refers to is maintainer only)

 * r1421380
   Issue #4272: s/assertion/error/ in the DAV proxy code.
   Justification:
     The assertion has been run into in the wild
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1421541
   Fix infinite recursion in './get-deps.sh'.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix to plug an edge case.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1422053
   Remove .swig_checked from tarball.
   Justification:
     Unnecessary file in tarballs.
   Votes:
     +1: breser

 * r1422100
   Delay storing handle to fix assert when rep-cache is inaccessible.
   Justification:
     It's an assert.
