This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1480080, r1481772, r1481847
   Instruct clang to not warn about unknown warning flags.
   Justification:
     Newer versions of clang accept warning flags that they do not
     support, but emit warnings about them instead -- making the
     compile output a mess with a warning emitted for every
     single C and C++ file in an optimized build (because
     of the -Wno-clobbered, see above).
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     +1: danielsh
     +0: rhuijben (looks ok, but I can't test or verify via code inspection)

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1489885, r1489928
   Resolve regression where 'svn ci ci' just returned success when 'ci' doesn't
   exist in the working copy.
   Justification:
     Improves usability of 'svn', and of the status api (for api users).
   Notes:
     This introduces a warning/error for a specific case via the status walker,
     so I'm not 100% sure if we should introduce this patch in this form in
     1.8.1 or later.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (Needs more work. Breaks JavaHL)

 * r1490679
   Allow test suite to run properly on Windows.
   Justification:
     Fixes a (very) minor test setup failure when running the ra_serf tests on
     Windows for the first time in a given environment.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, rhuijben

 * r1489339
   Return 501/412 rather than 401 for lock errors.
   Justification:
     Old values are not valid HTTP.
   Notes:
     Usually the authorization layer produces an error earlier. This patch
     should only change the behavior for repositories without authorization
     requirements for these operations.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1490684
   Return 500 rather than 409 when commit fails and it is not a conflict.
   Justification:
     Not a client failure so 4xx is wrong.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1491432
   Rename 'automatic merge' to 'complete merge' in the merge help text.
   Justification:
     Prevent user confusion. "Automatic merge" sounds too ambitious and
     may be misunderstood if not used in context. The term 'complete'
     refers to a merge which merges all outstanding changes from the
     source branch, i.e. sync or reintegrate.
   Notes:
     This should be merged for 1.8.0, if possible, else different client
     versions will name the feature in different ways.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1491707
   Add version header to svnpubsub server.
   Justification:
     Make Daniel happy; potentially allow proxies to filter on this or some
     hypothetical use case.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, breser

 * r1491770
   Eliminate revprop buffer size limit.
   Justification:
     This removes an inconsistency; we don't limit object sizes anywhere
     else. Particularly, we allowed for unlimited revprop sizes when setting
     them but had a 16MB limit in the getter.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, blair

  * r1491739, r1491755, r1491762
    Improve interactive conflict resolution menu.
    Justification:
      The current menu is too hard to figure out for users.
      See http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2013-06/0147.shtml
    Votes:
      +1: stsp

  * r1491816
    Add two additional options to interactive file merge.
    Justification:
      Usability enhancement for quicker conflict resolution in some cases.
      Very simple change. Only affects interactive mode, not scripts.
    Votes:
      +1: stsp

# 1.8.0-rc3 is being voted on currently and as such 1.8.0 is in the soak phase.
# Changes that are not intended for 1.8.0 should not be placed here and changes
# that would restart the soak should not be added unless they are resolving
