Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16344, r16347, r16358
    Branch: (to be created)
    Provide more complete server-side information about working copy
    items which are out of date in the repository.
    Justification:
      This info is extremely useful to Subversion clients; the first
      consumer is likely to be the "Synchronize" view of the Subclipse
      plug-in for the Eclipse IDE.

  * r16350
    Fix issue #1911, where svndumpfilter generated invalid dumpfiles
    when copies occurred and --drop-empty-revs and --renumber-revs
    were in use.
    Justification:
      Invalid dumpfiles are not nice.
