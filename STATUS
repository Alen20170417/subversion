This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan
     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

 * r1691928
   Fix issue #4584, "Non-canonical $HOME crashes GPG-agent support code".
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.8.11. Simple cause; simple fix.
   Notes:
     Also nominated for 1.8.x.
     Trunk has a better fix, but less suitable for backporting, in r1691952.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad
     +1: danielsh (either with or without r1691952; haven't tried to reproduce,
                   only reviewed the diff)
     +0: rhuijben (Can't test this part. +1 on the combination with r1691952.
                   I don't see returning a properly canonicalized path
                   instead of a potentially non canonical path as a breaking
                   change that can't be backported. I would call it a bugfix
                   that should be backported)

 * r1693886
   Fix an error leak in FSFS verification.
   Justification:
     Don't have memory leaks.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1694194
   Correct a parameter name in svn_repos_get_fs_build_parser5.
   Justification:
     The docstring shall match the actual declaration.
   Note:
     This is not an API change as it does not affect any user of that
     function nor does it break binary compatibility.  To keep the code
     churn low, the implementation has not been updated - it happens to
     use "parser" as the name of a local variable.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1694481
   Fix Unix build on systems without GPG agent.
   Justification:
     This is a user-reported issue.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
