This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1660593
   Fix recording last-* information on nodes copied from foreign repositories
   Justification:
     Recording revisions (and other details) of foreign repositories causes
     incorrect status output and bugs when using -rCOMMITTED, -rPREV, etc.
     Local fix.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1660646
   Fix calculating the repository path of replaced directories on entry upgrade
   Justification:
     Simple fix that avoids recording invalid data in WC-NG.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1660969, r1660975, r1660991, r1661120, r1661121
   Fix assertion reported as part of issue #4467,
   Justification:
     Fixing a few simple revision checks inside the blame handling allows the
     'kidney blame' to work without assertions failing.
   Notes:
     r1661120 adds a regression test for this assertion problem, in which
     it is required that the file doesn't change in the passed revision.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -1: julianfoad (assertion still fails on the test case)
                    (without r1661120, r1661121)
