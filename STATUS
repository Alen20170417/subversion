================

Candidate changes:

  * r20701, r20703
    Add 'neon' dependencies to svnsync, ra-local-test, and svn-push,
    working around libtool bug.
    Justification:
      Needed to successfully run tests if compiling against an installed Neon,
      and there are old Subversion libraries in the same directory as Neon.

      svn merge -r20702:HEAD $rs/branches/1.4.x-r20701
      # In case of svnmerge-integrated property conflict (inevitable unless
      # nothing else has been merged since the merge branch was created),
      # revert just the svnmerge-integrated property:
      svn ps svnmerge-integrated `svn pg -rbase svnmerge-integrated` .
      svn resolved .
      # and re-record the merge:
      svnmerge merge -M -F -r 20701,20703
