This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.17:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.

   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser
     -0: julianfoad (test is missing from branch -- how do we know it works?)

 * r1745515, r1746364
   Update serf download URIs to ASF.
   Justification:
     Resolves build script issues since the old google code URI is 404 now.
   Notes:
     Merge with --accept=working due to absence of
     tools/dev/build-svn-deps-win.pl on the 1.8 branch.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (without r1746364)
     +1: stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Makefile.svn is patched but not fixed)
     -0 (non-binding): luke1410 (r1700130 is missing - will have to create a
                       backport branch)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +1: stefan2
     -1: brane (Not a valid backport, contrib/ is not in the release tarball.)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1717875, r1717878
   Make inherited property api consistent over all ra layers
   Justification:
     Our ra implementations should follow the documentation... and should
     be as consistent as possible between each other. Only because the
     caller uses svn_path_url_add_component2() this wasn't noticed by
     our code.
   Notes:
     A test for this issue was added in r1717874, but requires plumbing
     that isn't available on 1.8.x
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2, brane

 * r1722860, r1722879, r1722887
   Memory access portability issues.
   Justification:
     Not complying to the C standard is bad.  At the very least we
     improve the signal/noise ratio when using memory sanitizers.
     Part of this patch set (r1722879) fixes a crash on SPARC that
     apparently gets masked by some lucky caller pattern.
     Finally, these changes make the code actually simpler.
   Notes:
     r1722860 fixes the issue originally reported on dev@.
     r1722879 fixes a follow-up issue found by the SPARC buildbot.
     r1722887 removes similar logic from the membuffer cache although
              that had not been reported a faulty.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-portability
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, stsp
     +1: brane, however: [[[
         subversion/libsvn_subr/utf_validate.c:273:28: warning: comparison of constant 128 with expression
               of type 'const char' is always false [-Wtautological-constant-out-of-range-compare]
             if (*data < 0 || *data >= 0x80)
                              ~~~~~ ^  ~~~~

        This is happily not exactly a bug because the '< 0' branch will
        catch these cases, but it's really messy ...]]]

 * r1724448, r1770355
   Fix handling of newly secured subdirectories in a working copy
   Justification:
     Regression against <= 1.6.x. Without this patch a directory that
     (still) exists locally but to which a user has no access is handled as
     a local obstruction on the next update that brings a change to this tree
     and the local working copy state is broken. This patch handles the
     incomming change as a delete, properly marking a tree conflict if
     necessary, allowing a user to make a copy of local changes.
     (Committing a copy would be hard though... as the user most likely
      doesn't have the rights to copy from what is now hidden).
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1724448
   Notes:
     r1770355 fixes a test failure specific to the backport branch.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, stefan2, brane
     +1: rhuijben (without r1770355)

 * r1766352, r1766590
   Fix issue #4658: Can't reconstruct fulltext from DELTA against PLAIN in FSFS
   Justification:
     Prevents access to committed data.  This is as close to a corruption one
     could get without actually corrupting anything.  User reported issue.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4658
   Notes:
     r1766352 contains the actual fix.
     r1766590 adds a test case for it.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, stsp, brane
     +0: rhuijben
