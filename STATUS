Status of 1.9.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1698312
   Correctly report empty representations in 'svnfsfs stats'.
   Justification:
     The current code displays the "0" bracket in histograms as
     "-2147483648 .. < 1" instead of "0 .. < 1".  Technically correct
     but annoying.  UI change only.

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.

     +0: julianfoad (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)

 * r1700215, r1700219, r1700220, r1701270
   Fix argument passing in test suite.
   Justification:
     Makes svnfsfs_tests.py work in fsfs-v4 and fsfs-v6 modes.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1700215
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Log level on standard invocation of win-tests.py changes)

 * r1701598, r1701603, r1701611, r1701646
   Make 'svn lock' and 'svn unlock' report (un)lock errors as failure
   Justification:
     A single lock or unlock failure doesn't affect the whole operation
     since 1.9, but this has the side effect of no longer producing an
     error at all on failures. This patch makes 'svn' return an error when
     at least one failure is reported by the locking code.
   Notes:
     r1701598 is the actual fix. The other patches simplify and fix
     test expectations.
   Votes:
     +0.9: rhuijben (Minor behavior change. Needs more dev@ discussion)

 * r1701638
   Remove unneeded io operation on pristine install
   Justification:
     Every IO operation counts in checkout performance. Doing something
     that is never necessary just slows things down. (The rename handling
     would handle read-only just fine... And matching SHA-1 is handled at
     a higher level)

     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1701997
   Fix crash due access to uninitialized pointer.
   Justification:
     Access to uninitialized pointer is some unknown conditions. Reported
     multiple times using TortoiseSVN crash reporter tool.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan

 * r1701838, r1702203
   Fix attempt to use uninitialized svn_wc__db_install_data_t pointer on
   error in working copy update editor. Reproduction script:
   $ svn co URL wc --depth=empty
   $ rm -rf wc/.svn/tmp
   $ svn up wc --set-depth=infinity
   Justification:
     Crash. Reported multiple times using TortoiseSVN crash reporter tool.
   Depends:
     Depends on the r1702198, r1702200 backport due conflicts in
     update_tests.py.

     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1702198, r1702200

   Justification:

   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1702237, r1702238, r1702239

   Fix potential access to uninitialized memory during 'svn commit'.
   I don't know exact reproduction script, but it's obvious bug and
   crash reported via TortoiseSVN crash dump service multiple times.
   Justification:
     Segfault. User reported.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1701064, r1701206, r1701298, r1701736
   Fix Access Denied errors on checkout/update with working copies stored on
   SMBv1 network shares [1], [2]. This also should fix potential spurious
   'access denied' errors with local working copies and background
   indexers/antiviruses.
   [1] http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-09/0054.shtml
   [2] http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=4061&dsMessageId=3134203
   Justification:
     Regression from Subversion 1.8.x.
   Notes:
     The r1701298, r1701736 patches are the fix (re-introduce a retry loop to
     handle cases where the target of the replacement is still open by another
     application and handle access denied for SMBv1), r1701064 and r1701206
     are just formatting fixes and cleanups.
