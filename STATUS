This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

   Rev the svn_ra_get_uuid and svn_ra_get_repos_root interfaces to get a
   more natural API, where the pool you provide is actually meaningful
   and the returned value is allocated in it as you might expect.
   This fixes JavaHL tests on 1.5.x branch.  Seems to be a memory corruption
   issue.
