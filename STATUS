This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10385:
    Make svnserve CRAM-MD5 work for usernames containing spaces.
    Justification:
      one-line fix, and it's a silly bug.
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson, sussman, brane

  * r10394:
    Make svnserve use repos UUID as default realm.
    Justification:
      fixes 'changing realm' bug in path computation.
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson, sussman, brane

  * r10389, r10398:
    Don't always patch the apr-util files for BDB when generating
    Windows build scripts (introduced in r10206).
    Justification:
      trivial fix, avoids breaking the apr-util build by mistake,
      will make my life easier as long as the 1.1.x branch is live.
      r10389 is a doc and utility fix for r10206.
    Votes:
      +3: brane. That should be enough :-)

  * r10405:
    Make sure to use BDB for BDB-specific operations.
    Justification: Fixes embarassing crashes when built without BDB.

      +1: ghudson, brane, lundblad

  * r10386, r10388:
    Add IRI support and URI ato-escaping (issue #1910).
    Justification: Nice usability feature, which could go in if we restart
      the soak period for other reasons.
    Note: r10388 is wrong if it goes into 1.1, but I don't want to change it
      before I know if this is accepted...

  * r10431
    Disable wait_for_input on Windows.
    Justification: Fix prompting on Windows so it actually works right.
    Votes:
      +1: breser, sussman, cmpilato

  * r10440
    Fix pool usage for SVN::Ra in the Perl bindings.
    Justification:
      Bindings only, important fixes for long-life ra sessions.
    Votes:
      +1: clkao

  * r10353, r10375
    Fix encoding of get_repos_url result.
    Justification: Also fixes a bug in svnserve with encoded
     characters in paths.  See
     http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svn/archive-2004-07/1334.shtml
     for a description of the bug.
    Note: This change is sufficiently big in scope and raw size to
     warrant restarting the soak period.  It would be possible to
     construct a more minimal change for the release branch, but that
     work hasn't been done, and it's not worth it if we're going to
     restart the 1.1 soak anyway.  But don't merge until we've come to
     a decision on whether to restart the 1.1 soak.
    Votes:
      +1: ghudson (r10353 only)
      +1: lundblad

  * r10400, r10401
    Perl bindings build fixes.
    r10400: Add cygwin to the list of platforms requiring explicit linking of
      apr.
    r10401: Transfer some libsvn_swig_perl dependencies incorrectly listed as
      nonlibs to libs.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r10422
    Python bindings build fix. Make the compile flags more like distutils uses,
    avoiding large amounts of compiler warnings.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb

  * r10410, r10450
    Python bindings build fix. Explicitly link libpython to the python bindings.
    r10410 is a trivial usage message update, included to avoid merge conflicts.
