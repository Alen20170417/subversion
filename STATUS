This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20781
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      -1: cmpilato (this is a very odd place to do this.  dist.sh, perhaps?)

  * r20833, r20836
    Provide named, separate debug information files for clients building
    against Subversion libraries.
    Justification:
      Very low impact and silences hundreds of warnings about missing debug
      information when linking to Subversion libraries.

Approved changes:

  * r20886 (depends on r20833 group above)
    Allow javahl to build with VC Express and fix its debug symbol files.
    Justification:
      Low impact and allows javahl to build on VC Express.
