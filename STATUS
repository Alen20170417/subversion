Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10368
    Don't segfault when following history and we find an empty revision.
    Justificaton: Don't ever segfault.
    Votes:
      +1: breser, sussman, cmpilato (sussman and cmpilato via IRC)

  * r10371:
    Mark python and perl bindings modules "undefined-lib-symbols = yes".
    This is because they require symbols from libperl/libpython, which we
    don't explicitly link to.
