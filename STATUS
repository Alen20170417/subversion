Status of 1.4.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21346
    Explicitly close the FSFS prototype revision file after writing a
    representation.
    Justification:
      An error handling improvement which allows us to detect and
      handle any problems that occur during that final write.

  * r21384, r21047
    A merge which results in a conflicted file in your WC should
    produce a "conflicted" merge notification.  'svn merge --dry-run'
    needs to be smarter about accessing the working copy (see issue
    #2584).
