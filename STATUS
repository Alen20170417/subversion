This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10389, r10398:
    Don't always patch the apr-util files for BDB when generating
    Windows build scripts (introduced in r10206).
    Justification:
      trivial fix, avoids breaking the apr-util build by mistake,
      will make my life easier as long as the 1.1.x branch is live.
      r10389 is a doc and utility fix for r10206.
    Votes:
      +3: brane. That should be enough :-)
      +0: breser. Don't know enough about the Windows build to be +1

  * r10386, r10388:
    Add IRI support and URI auto-escaping (issue #1910).
    Justification: Nice usability feature, which could go in if we restart
      the soak period for other reasons.
    Note: r10388 is wrong if it goes into 1.1, but I don't want to change it
      before I know if this is accepted...
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, sussman
      +1: kfogel (with the obvious tweak to r10388, on both trunk and branch)
      -0 breser (I'm still not sure this belongs in 1.1.0, but I don't see
                 anything technically wrong with it).

  * r10422
    Python bindings build fix. Make the compile flags more like distutils uses,
    avoiding large amounts of compiler warnings.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, ghudson
      +0: breser

  * r10410, r10450
    Python bindings build fix. Explicitly link libpython to the python
    bindings.  r10410 is a trivial usage message update, included to
    avoid merge conflicts.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      +0: breser (don't fully understand the python code but looks okay to me)

  * r10473
    Fix OS X build.
    Justification: Should work out of the tarball.
    Votes:
      +1: breser
      +0: kfogel (looks good to me, but I don't have an OS X system here)

  * r10379,r10380,r10384,r10469,r10470,r10487
    Support creation of zip archives for Windows.
    Justification:
      Long since planed.
    Notes:
      r10487 really doesn't need a vote, but I included it for completness.
    Votes:
      +1: breser
