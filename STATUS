This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.18:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser
     -0: julianfoad (test is missing from branch -- how do we know it works?)

 * r1745515, r1746364
   Update serf download URIs to ASF.
   Justification:
     Resolves build script issues since the old google code URI is 404 now.
   Notes:
     Merge with --accept=working due to absence of
     tools/dev/build-svn-deps-win.pl on the 1.8 branch.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (without r1746364)
     +1: stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Makefile.svn is patched but not fixed)
     -0 (non-binding): luke1410 (r1700130 is missing - will have to create a
                       backport branch)

 * r1785053
   Never attempt to share directory representations in FSFS.
   Justification:
     This fixes inconsistent behavior.  We never add dir reps to the rep-
     cache but would happily share any file or prop rep that happens to
     match the respective directory rep.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1785053
   Notes:
     Will create a text conflict with the strict-rep-sharing patches.
     Depending on which change gets merged first, the respective other
     needs to be updated.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, rhuijben

 * r1785737, r1785738, r1785734, r1786447, r1785754, r1786445, r1786446, r1786515, r1794611
   Make FSFS consistency no longer depend on hash algorithms.
   Justification:
     This eliminates any existing or future FSFS vulnerability due to
     attacks on MD5 or SHA1.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-strict-rep-sharing
   Notes:
     Depends on r1759116 for correctness with older APR.
     While the backport code is very close to the /trunk changes, it is
     easier to review them as r1787637, r1787638 and r1787652 on the branch.
     Will create a text conflict with the r1785053 backport.  Depending on
     which change gets merged first, the respective other must be updated.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +1: rhuijben (without r1794611)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +1: stefan2
     -1: brane (Not a valid backport, contrib/ is not in the release tarball.)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1759116
   Work around an APR bug in svn_io_file_trunc with buffered r/w files.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, trunc() will leave buffered file objects with
     alternating read and write accesses in an inconsistent state.  Apart
     from being a bug in one of our public APIs, this will cause corruptions
     in FSFS when the strict-rep-sharing patches get backported.
