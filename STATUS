This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1697381, r1697384, r1697387, r1697967
   Make 'svnfsfs load-index' work as advertised in the documentation
   Justification:
     svnfsfs load-index would only ever be used in high-stress situations
     like desaster recovery.  So, while workarounds are possible, having
     people jump though a few extra hoops is a bad thing in that context.
   Notes:
     r1697381 - fixes the revision rewriting code (only used by this tool)
     r1697384 - Makes dump format match expected input format
     r1697387 - Implement sorting of the columns on input
     r1697967 - Provides a test case
     BH: Some tests around this would make this much easier to review.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, brane
     +1: rhuijben (Without r1697381, r1697967. Takes more time to review)

 * r1697914
   Fix alignment fault in ra_svn on 32 bit SPARC machines.
   Justification:
     RA_svn is basically unusuable on that platform.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, brane

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1694481, r1697824
   Fix Unix build on systems without GPG agent.
   Justification:
     This is a user-reported issue.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stefan2, rhuijben
     +1: philip (without r1697824)

 * r1697835
   Fix compiler warning about const/non-const pointer conversion.
   Justification:
     Whilst we don't usually backport compiler warning fixes, this one
     is fallout from the r1696222 group backport.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1697845
   Fix compiler warning about empty while statement body.
   Justification:
     Whilst we don't usually backport compiler warning fixes, this one
     is caused by a bug in a macro definition, which this backport fixes.
