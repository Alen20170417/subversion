Status of 1.8.10:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: ivan, brane (not regression from 1.7.x,
                      destructive change in libsvn_wc core)
     -0: rhuijben (temporarily remove my +1 until I complete investigating
                   a related problem. It looks like this fix doesn't work for
                   the user scenario it was intended for)

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +0: breser (I'd be +1 if not for the unused function in svnadmin_tests.py)

 * r1542610, r1564576, r1568180
   Add missing description to build.conf, to properly generate a version
   resource (including icon) for this executable on Windows.
   Notes:
     r1564576 breaks compilation on Visual Studio 2010, 2012 and 2013 of
     this project. r1568180 fixes this problem.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, breser
     +1: (without r1564567, r1568180): stsp
     -0: brane (horrible grammar; suggest translation to English)

 * r1555491
   Fix svn_fs_close_root for FSFS transaction roots.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, cache-related pool cleanups may be run after the
     svn_fs_t object has been destroyed.  I.e. even with explicit calls to
     svn_fs_close_root, the user may see a segfault.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1555491
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     -0: philip, rhuijben (Seems to be a different name for the same pool?)

 * r1561426
   In FSFS, skip the generation of uniquifiers if rep-shared is no supported.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1561426
   Justification:
     This is not known to be a bug, atm, as we omit these when we write the
     final revisions.  But we rely on those uniquifiers to be NULL in old
     repo formats when we compare reps.  Them being non-NULL in a txn might
     cause problems with future changes.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser

 * r1589360
   Make property output in 'svn diff' stable
   Justification:
     Local change that makes it easier to compare patch files.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1589360
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -0: stefan2 (compiler misses "private/svn_sorts_private.h",
                  before branch)

 * r1590751
   Use empty, rather than NULL, config if default is unreadable.
   Justification:
     svn SEGV reported by user.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     -0: julianfoad (prefer to fix all the programs at the same time;
                     other queries -- see email thread)

 * r1592014, r1592034
   Fix 'svn patch' skipping targets in valid --git diffs.
   Justification:
     'svn patch' should parse --git diffs correctly. User complained.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2014-05/0003.shtml and replies.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, breser

 * r1600331, r1600348, 1600368, r1600563, r1600781
   Improve gpg-agent support.
   Justification: Avoids spurious error logs, supports standard socket
     locations and removes double prompts from pinentry.  Without these
     changes it's far less desireable to use.
   Notes:
     Branch is needed since SVN_VA_NULL is not available in 1.8.x.
     This does change the behavior of gpg-agent from prompting twice
     for the password with pinentry to confirm the user hasn't entered
     an incorrect password to instead clearing bad cached passwords and
     reprompting.  See my email on the subject: https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201406.mbox/%3C538D2BE5.3070706%40reser.org%3E
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-gpg-agent
   Votes:
     +1: breser, philip

 * r1612225
   Ignore ENOTIMPL and EINCOMPLETE errors when tweaking temporary file
   permission bits on non-windows systems.
   Justification:
     These errors imply the underlying filesystem doesn't support
     permissions. svn_io_copy_perms handles these errors in the
     same way.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, breser

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -1: breser (see my email to dev@, <5282FE15.40505@reser.org>)

 * r1560723, r1561419, r1561427, r1561428
   Fix the handling of pre-1.4 FSFS repositories.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1560723-and-friends
   Justification:
     Without this, old SVN versions won't be able to e.g. hotcopy those
     repos once 1.8.x made a commit in them.  Also, fix our hotcopy code
     and make it cope with repositories broken by previous 1.8.x releases.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     -1: ivan (Significant performance degradation for svnadmin hotcopy,
               the root cause is not fixed. Discussion:
               http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2014-01/0158.shtml)

 * r1611379, r1612405
   Fix revprop caching initialization delays for ra_serf on Windows.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, even small checkouts may take 20 to 40
     seconds longer.  This patch switches the named atomics SHM
     initialization guard to the same "never delete the lock file"
     pattern that we use for FSFS-internal locks.
   Notes:
     Branch is needed since SVN_VA_NULL is not available in 1.8.x.
     Same goes for svn_io_file_create_empty.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1611379
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, brane, breser
     -1: ivan (Race condition and undefined behavior. See:
               http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2014-08/0007.shtml)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1565531, r1566503, r1568349, r1568361
   Ignore the CommonName in SSL certs when there are Subject Alt Names.
   Justification:
     Comply with RFC 2818.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, stefan2, ivan
