This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.7:
============================

 * r36106
   Resolves issue #3374, "svn cp --parents path URL encoding issues"
   For
     svn cp --parent ^/fö ^/dö/fö
   The --parents code checked and might creat^/d%C3%B6, while the file was
   copied to ^/dö as expected.
   Justification:
     Without this patch --parents is broken for utf8 characters in repos
     to repos copy and move operations.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -0: gstein (encoding issues are tricky; I'd rather tell people to
                 upgrade to 1.6.0, rather than 1.5.6)

 * r36111
   On Windows don't retry deleting a file 100 times when this file is really
   not a file but just a directory.
   Justification:
     Makes removing unversioned directories much faster.
     (You can see the delay with: svn rm --force <unversioned-empty-directory>)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     -0: gstein (edge case performance fixes shouldn't be backported; if
                 the user wants the fix, they can upgrade to 1.6.0 rather
                 than 1.5.6)

 * r35930
   Adjust basic_tests.py 12 for compatability with Windows and Python 2.5+.
   Justification:
     The mode 'rw+' is invalid with Python 2.5+ on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, pburba

 * r36159
   Fix proxying of LOCK and UNLOCK requests via WebDAV proxies.
   Justification:
     With the fix, each slave server tries to field the lock/unlock, resulting
     in competing ideas of what is and isn't locked.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato
