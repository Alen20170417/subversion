Candidate changes for 1.5.2:
============================

 * r32409
   Fix an incompatibility with BSD make, which was introduced in r24293.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix. Fixes out-of-tree build of the bindings on BSD.
     Might help downstream packagers for these systems.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r32706, r32707, r32730
   Fix another issue #3067 bug where subtree mergeinfo can occur that
   breaks the merge editor drive.
   Notes:
     r32706 is a new test, r32707 is the fix.  r32730 is an obvious
     fix (comment formatting tweak).
   Justification:
     We've already encountered this problem in our own repository when
     trying to synch up the fs-rep-sharing branch with trunk (sorry no
     thread to reference, only discussed in IRC but the new test in r32706
     shows how it can happen).
