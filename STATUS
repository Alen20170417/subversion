Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

   * r16979
     Use apr_int64_t and apr_uint64_t in place of "long long" in Ruby typemaps.
     Justification:
       "long long" is not portable.

       +1: djames

   * r16980, r16982
     Fix broken "long long *OUTPUT" typemaps in Perl and Python bindings.
     Justification:
       Broken typemaps can lead to incorrect bindings.
     Votes:
       +1: djames

   * r16984, r16985
     Update APR typemaps to be more portable, so that they will work on
     platforms with non-standard integer sizes.
     Votes:
       +1: djames

Approved changes:

   * r16930, r16975, r16989, r16990
     Actually fix the cause of perl bindings segfault by allocating for
     result_digest, and make it overloaded object that actually reads
     the digest when accessing.
     Justification:
       Bindings segfaults.
     Notes:
       r16975 actually reverts r16930.
     Depends: r16966
