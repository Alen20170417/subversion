This file tracks the status of changes proposed for inclusion in 1.0.
Each candidate consists of a short identifying block (e.g., a revision
number, maybe an issue number), a brief description of the change, and
an at-most-one-line justification of why it should be in 1.0, followed
by the votes.  For example:

   * r98765 (issue #56789)
     Use an opaque type for svn_ra_get_ansible(), instead of void *.
     Justification: API stability

A change needs three +1 votes from full committers, and no vetoes, to
go into the release.

Voting for a change doesn't just mean you approve of it in principle.
It means you have thoroughly reviewed the change, and find it correct
and as nondisruptive as possible.  When it is committed to the release
branch, the log message will include the names of all who voted for
it, as well as the original author and the person making the commit.
All of these people are considered equally answerable for bugs.

   * Issue #999
     Anchor/target split may use NULL for target.
     Justification: API consistency
     Notes: Greg Hudson has said he has no intention of merging this
            into trunk unless it goes into 1.0 too, as doesn't want
            trunk to start out its new life with an API divergence.
