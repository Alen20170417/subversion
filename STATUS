This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

NOTE:  This branch uses svnmerge.py for merge tracking.  Please familiarize
yourself with that tool if you plan to actually merge changes here.

For example, to merge a number of revisions from trunk into branch,
you can use the svnmerge.py script that is in the branch.

$ contrib/client-side/svnmerge.py merge -r 21000-21006,21008,21876
$ svn diff
$ svn commit

Do not run svnmerge.py N separate times for each revision to merge
over, since svnmerge.py will not merge into a WC with uncommitted
changes.

Status of 1.4.3:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r21531, r21848, r21934
    Allow HTTP auth protocols to be configurable by way of a
    "http-auth-types" parameter.
    Justification:
      Allow GSSAPI/SSPI auth to be enabled/disabled on Windows with
      Neon 0.26.1+, addressesing numerous bug reports from
      TortoiseSVN, Subversion, Subclipse, etc.

      -1: cmpilato (new features showing up in patch releases?  nuh-uh.)

  * r21885, r22076
    Add a new RPM package for the AuroraLinux 2.0 SPARC distribution.
    Justification:
      It is a combination of RHEL3 and RHEL4 distributions with
      characteristics matching both, so we need a new directory.
    Branch: 1.4.x-r22076 (-r22079:HEAD)
    Votes:
      +1: dws
      -1: maxb (It appears that the auroralinux-2 directory has been based
                on an old version of the rhel-3 directory, pre-dating some
                of the difference-reduction work I did to try to minimize the
                unnecessary inconsistencies between the various distro
                flavours. Its introduction therefore represents a regression
                in the maintainability of the RPM packaging area as a whole.)

  * r22253 through r22286
    svn-graph.pl: Update invocation of $ra->get_log() to account for
    the Perl API's $limit parameter.  Drastically improve UI and
    implementation.
    Justification:
      Incorrect API usage results in a completely broken script.  Old
      algorithm wasn't quite right, either.
    Notes: Copy r22286 from trunk to the 1.4.x branch.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr

  * r22346, r22351, r22352
    Calculate checksums in ra_replay and repos_replay.
    Justification:
      Integrity checks for svnsync and SVK are good, and this
      is fixing things marked as "###".  While it's arguably
      a feature, is fully compatible and is more a matter of
      filling in unfinished work.

      +1: glasser, jerenkrantz

  * r22501
    Fix script used to build our Solaris package.
    Justification:
      Simple fix, with the script completely broken as-is.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, jerenkrantz

  * r22729
    Fix potential filesystem memory leak in commit-finalization loop.
    Justification:
      Memory leaks are bad.  New implementation is more scalable.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, jerenkrantz

  * r19808-19810, r22853
    Synchronise license text and then bump copyright dates to 2007.
    Justification:
      It's 2007.
    Notes: We might want to wait until we actually merge something we
      originally committed in 2007, possibly hold until 1.4.4?
    Votes:
      +1: malcolm, dlr, hwright
      -1: jerenkrantz (This is an unnecessary change to backport.)

Approved changes:

  * r22609
    Make svn_repos_replay2 able to send deltas when used with txn roots.
    Justification:
      Make the api do what's promised.
    Votes:
      +1: glasser, dlr, jerenkrantz
      +1: clkao (tested but vote not counted)

  * r22825/r22824
    Fix issue #2684, reporting of a circular dependency if an authz
    group is used by more than one other group.
    Justification:
      Fixes overzealous validation which blocks actual functionality.
      Regression against 1.3.x.
    Branch: 1.4.x-issue-2684
