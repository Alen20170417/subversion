Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)

 * r1705038
   Fix issue 4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1722164
   Filter out -Wdate-time from SWIG_CPPFLAGS
   Justification:
     Fixes bindings build failure when -Wdate-time is present in $CPPFLAGS
   Votes:
     +1: jamessan
     +1: rhuijben (Would prefer some redesign for trunk though)

 * r1721488, r1721648
   Enable building bindings with SWIG >= 3.0.6
   Justification:
     Enable building bindings with SWIG 3.x.  SWIG 2.x is end-of-life (no
     releases since 2014) and is starting to be removed from Linux
     distributions.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1721488
   Votes:
     +1: jamessan

 * r1721285
   Quadruple the maximum cacheable directory size in FSFS.
   Justification:
     Not caching large directories has a massive impact on runtime with
     the cutoff point being about 9000 entries for the default cache size.
     Also, memory usage with mod_dav_svn may go through the roof for
     uncached directories.

     -0: stsp (merge conflict; needs a backport branch)
              (rhuijben: Are you sure? svn merge doesn't produce a conflict
               for me)
              (stsp: Merge conflict appears only with svn-trunk, not 1.9.x)

 * r1724448
   Fix handling of newly secured subdirectories in a working copy
   Justification:
     Regression against <= 1.6.x. Without this patch a directory that
     (still) exists locally but to which a user has no access is handled as
     a local obstruction on the next update that brings a change to this tree
     and the local working copy state is broken. This patch handles the
     incomming change as a delete, properly marking a tree conflict if
     necessary, allowing a user to make a copy of local changes.
     (Committing a copy would be hard though... as the user most likely
      doesn't have the rights to copy from what is now hidden).
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

* r1758128, r1758129, r1758130, r1758153
  Fix issue #4647.
  Justification:
    Resolves a regression in TSVN 1.9 with the binary conflict resolution
    dialog erroring out when selecting to resolve the conflict with the
    local file.
  Notes:
    r1758129 contains the actual fix.
    r1758153 corrects paths in the original fix.
    r1758128 adds the regression test.
    r1758130 removes the regression test's XFail marker
  Votes:
    +1 (non-binding): luke1410
    +1: stsp

 * r1759116, r1759116, r1759122, r1759123, r1759124
   Fix FSFS format 7 packing for revisions packs with lots of changes.
   Justification:
     Problem occurred in at least two user repositories.  Without the fix,
     format 7 repositories with an exceptionally large number of changes in
     a pack cannot be packed - which renders using f7 pointless for those
     users.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-fsfs-pack-fixes
   Notes:
     r1759116 adds a workaround for trunc() corrupting apr_file_t internal state.
     r1759116-23 provide the actual fixes.
     r1759124 adds a regression test with the necessary internal API changes.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1734106
   Fix a bug where the wrong source left revision was recorded in a tree
   conflict.
   Justification:
     Conflict info recorded in WC should be correct.
     Fix will help users who upgrade to 1.10 with conflicts recorded in WC.
     Also, merging this allows r1760570 to merge cleanly.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

 * r1760570
   Fix a spurious 'incoming edit' tree conflict with an unmodified file.
   Justification:
     Tree conflicts should not be raised unnecessarily.
   Notes:
     Depends on r1734106 to be merged first to avoid a text conflict
     in the test suite code.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1761334
   Fix issue #4653: SVN_LOCALE_DIR incorrectly interpolated when
   prefix is not set explicitly.
   Justification:
     ./configure with no arguments should just work.
   Votes:
     +1: brane
     +0: rhuijben (patch looks safe, but not sure enough for +1)

 * r1761755
   Fix link error with --disable-keychain behavior on OS/X
   Justification:
     User reported problem. Easy fix.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1762338, r1762339
   Fix issue #4655: add zlib discovery through pkg-config.
   Justification:
     Allows building Subversion with non-default zlib layouts, such as
     with libraries in $zlib_prefix/lib/hpux32 on HP-UX.
   Votes:
     +1: kotkov

 * r1763934
   Add the OSX 10.12 commercial name for 'svn --version --verbose'.
   Justification:
     Very minor change makes SVN look slightly more polished.

     +1: brane, ivan
