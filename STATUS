Status of 1.8.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1498000
   Improve error handling for inherited property requests by using the
   transition based xml parser in libsvn_ra_serf.
   Justification:
     This maintenance work which usually doesn't belong in a patch release
     makes it possible to properly detect if this request should be restarted
     on non-chunk-enabled proxies.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1496127
   Fix occasional failure of checkout_tests.py 12.
   Justification:
     Spurious FAILs confuse people testing the release.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     -0: danielsh (loses functionality; patch sent with alternative fix)
     stsp: where exactly is the alternative patch?
     danielsh: http://mid.gmane.org/20130705040533.GL3244@lp-shahaf.local

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: ivan, brane (not regression from 1.7.x,
                      destructive change in libsvn_wc core)
     -0: rhuijben (temporarily remove my +1 until I complete investigating
                   a related problem. It looks like this fix doesn't work for
                   the user scenario it was intended for)

 * r1534149, r1535676
   In the windows CryptoAPI ssl certificate verification, properly handle
   certificates that are only trusted via intermediate authorities.
   Justification:
      While not strictly a bug, intermediate authorities are getting more
      common since recent Certificate Authority incidents.
   Notes:
      rhuijben: This introduces a new credential type as private API.
      Not sure about our strict ABI guarantees here, but this affects
      usability of users migrating to cloud platforms, etc.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, steveking

 * r1531014, r1532316, r1536350, r1536383, r1536464, r1536488
   Fix working copy database inconsistency on certain move scenarios,
   including those described in issue #4437 "Deleting a moved file can maintain a
   half move"
   Justification:
     The working copy database should be consistent on any normal operation.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1518942, r1536914, r1536931
   Fix commit of a specific mixed revision copy with non copy descendants that
   shadow not present nodes. This problem manifests itself as a copy of a tree
   that can't be committed because it is reported out of date.
   Justification:
     'svn cp TREE NEW-TREE; svn ci NEW-TREE' should never report out of date
     on some random descendant.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536931
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1536854
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1537018
   Fix issue #4440, "Subversion sets permissions on files, when it shouldn't"
   Justification:
     Bug introduced by me. Unreasonable behaviour. User complained.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, stefan2
     +0.5: rhuijben (Change looks sane, but I'm unable to test this)

 * r1538812, r1538925, r1538928, r1538939
   Properly remove moved_to information when the node in its original location
   is removed.
   Justification:
     The NODES table in the working copy database should always be consistent.
   Notes:
     rhuijben: The test for this problem might accidentally depend on other
               move fixes on trunk.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1542610
   Add missing description to build.conf, to properly generate a version
   resource (including icon) for this executable on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp
     -0: brane (horrible grammar; suggest translation to English)

 * r1544597, r1544600, r1544688, r1544690, r1545111, r1545122
   Fix a specific case where the api behind status would report a different
   move status for A depending on whether the user called 'svn status A' or
   'svn status wc' and then looked at 'wc/A'.
   Justification:
     Api users such as AnkhSVN rely on the result of svn status to match and
     this breaks their assumptions.
     This change has the nice side effect that it resolves the most common
     user triggerable assertion in AnkhSVN, which is really caused by a
     broken move. (See other nomination for a fix). But even then it shouldn't
     matter how status is called: on the node or an ancestor.
     (It also improves status performance a tiny bit, by reducing the number
      of sqlite transactions used)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1548486
   When (during merge) we compare three files to each other stop reading
   specific files when we find enough differences.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix that can have a huge performance impact for some users.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1549858, r1549874
   Make svn_client_proplist4() behave as documented when reporting inherited
   properties.
   Justification:
     The current implementation with multiple callbacks for the same path
     just makes things hard on api users that want to use inherited properties
     as intended.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1541638, r1545302
   Fix automatic relocate during update for working copies that are
   not at repository root.
   Justification:
     Makes it much easier on users when their hoster migrates from http
     to https. (Too bad that there is no way to safely transfer credentials..)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1551524, 1551579
   Fix an 'No Write Lock' error when moving files between externals and
   parent working copies or vice versa.
   Justification:
     svn move should just work in these cases.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1553101, r1553105, r1553113
   Resolve performance regression in certain 'svn log' scenarios, especially
   against pre Subversion 1.5 servers.
   Justification:
     Easy fix for improving performance for everybody. More generic patch for
     old versions might be needed for other scenarios, but those scenarios
     were never supported on those old versions itself.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1553376, r1553377
   Fix pool lifetime issue in serf commit processing for copied files and dirs
   Justification:
     Pool lifetime issues are bad. Reported by several git-svn users.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1555491
   Fix svn_fs_close_root for FSFS transaction roots.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, cache-related pool cleanups may be run after the
     svn_fs_t object has been destroyed.  I.e. even with explicit calls to
     svn_fs_close_root, the user may see a segfault.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1555491
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, rhuijben

 * r1554978
   In FSFS, svn_fs_get_file_delta_stream shall return strictly the delta requested.
   Justification:
     The delta stream returned here has been valid (a self-delta is a valid
     txdelta against *any* source) but it may not strictly be what the user
     requested.  As a side effect, this will produce smaller deltified dumps.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1554978
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, rhuijben

 * r1555499
   Release internal FS objects when closing a commit editor.
   Justification:
     close_edit() and abort_edit() are supposed to do a complete internal
     cleanup - albeit the API docs are slightly fuzzy about that.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, rhuijben

 * r1557522
   Make mod_dav_svn report all property changes in 'include-properties' mode,
   even in uncommon configurations.
   Justification:
     This needs a fix in either client or server if we ever want to restart
     using the report copyfrom mode.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1535610
   Filter out -no-cpp-precomp from flags passed to SWIG.
   Justification:
     Fixing swig bindings on OS X when used with the majority of the APR
     versions that incorrectly include this in their --cppflags output.
   Votes:
     +1: breser
     +0: rhuijben (looks good, untested)

 * r1547454
   In FSFS, omit config file when creating pre-1.5 format repositories.
   Justification:
     Old SVN versions won't preserve this file in hotcopy.  Later versions
     might also behave inconsistently in the presence of this file if their
     feature availability check is incomplete.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1561426
   In FSFS, skip the generation of uniquifiers if rep-shared is no supported.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1561426
   Justification:
     This is not known to be a bug, atm, as we omit these when we write the
     final revisions.  But we rely on those uniquifiers to be NULL in old
     repo formats when we compare reps.  Them being non-NULL in a txn might
     cause problems with future changes.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1560723, r1561419, r1561427, r1561428
   Fix the handling of pre-1.4 FSFS repositories.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1560723-and-friends
   Justification:
     Without this, old SVN versions won't be able to e.g. hotcopy those
     repos once 1.8.x made a commit in them.  Also, fix our hotcopy code
     and make it cope with repositories broken by previous 1.8.x releases.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -1: breser (see my email to dev@, <5282FE15.40505@reser.org>)
