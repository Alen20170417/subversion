This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.0:
================

  * r14699
    Fix arg parsing so 'svn log --limit CHANGES' errors as it should.
    Justification:
       Much user time could otherwise be wasted by this; fix is trivial.
    Notes:
      Use http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.2.x-r14699 for merge.

Status of 1.2.1:
================

Candidate changes:

(none)

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r14514
    Fix segfault in status's handling of svn:externals directories.
    Justification:
      See above about "segfault".
    Notes:
      If this gets three +1's before 1.2.0-rc<final> comes out, then
      let's please merge it then.  I only put it in 1.2.1 because I
      didn't think this change should delay 1.2.0.  -kfogel
