delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.2:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1498000
   Improve error handling for inherited property requests by using the
   transition based xml parser in libsvn_ra_serf.
   Justification:
     This maintenance work which usually doesn't belong in a patch release
     makes it possible to properly detect if this request should be restarted
     on non-chunk-enabled proxies.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1496127
   Fix occasional failure of checkout_tests.py 12.
   Justification:
     Spurious FAILs confuse people testing the release.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     -0: danielsh (loses functionality; patch sent with alternative fix)
     stsp: where exactly is the alternative patch?
     danielsh: http://mid.gmane.org/20130705040533.GL3244@lp-shahaf.local

 * r1501199, r1501207, r1502777
   Verify the result of the xml parser in ra serf, instead of assuming the
   parsing always succeeds.
   Justification:
     While in general we can just rely on the parsed result being incomplete,
     this makes many network (and server implementation) problems easier to
     diagnose.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben
     -0: ivan (not regression from 1.7.x, destructive change in libsvn_wc core)

 * r1501656, r1501702
   Fix the ability to build Debug Build with BDB FS on Windows.
   Justification:
     Our build system should work properly.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Not a regression and I don't think we should encourage
                   building with just a debug BDB (even for release mode)
                   by backporting this change. That would require using the
                   non-distributable debug CRT. Trunk has a cleaner
                   detection of BDB (via db.h) and even while debugging a
                   maintainer build of Subversion a release BDB works fine)

 * r1502267
   Enforce strict version equality between cmdline tools and libraries.
   Justification:
     Without this, a 1.8.1 client will use a 1.8.2 libsvn_* library if that's
     what the runtime linker finds.  This may be a (hard-to-diagnose) problem
     due to possible incompatibilities in the subversion/include/private/ APIs
     used.
   Branch: 1.8.x-r1502267
   Notes:
     Seen in the wild under 1.7.x.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1502901
   Make ra_serf sessions reusable after a log callback uses the
   SVN_ERR_CEASE_INVOCATION error.
   Justification:
     Without this patch a new session would be required for each of these
     usages.
     Required by the r1468980 group.
   Notes:
     Resets the connection used by ra_serf to avoid having to read all data,
     which is mostly the same behavior as not re-using the ra session.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1468980, r1478987, r1502811
   Reduce the number of ra sessions for automatic merge calculations to two.
   Justification:
     10 concurrent ra sessions open to a single server at the same time breaks
     in certain setups (e.g. xinetd svnserve), while we really don't need this
     many. Opening ra session is still a performance killer in all other
     scenarios, so reducing the number of sessions is a good thing.
   Notes:
     Depends on r1502901 and r1502909, to avoid ra-session reuse errors.
     r1468980 is a small performance tweak needed for a clean merge.
     r1478987 removes a common ra session.
     r1502811 avoids all ra session creations via svn_client__mergeinfo_log.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1503010, r1503058, r1503061, r1503211
   svn_utf_*: Describe APR errors as coming from APR.
   Justification:
     It is not obvious what needs to be recompiled to resolve "This function
     has not been implemented on this platform".  We do the same for SQLite.
     .
     The current code will not enter the error path in the ENOTIMPL case; that
     is being discussed on dev@ still.  The "Justification" field uses that
     error code is used as an example only.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +1 (without r1503211): stefan2

 * r1503318
   ra_serf: Do not retry HTTP requests if we started to parse them.
   Discussion: http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2013-07/0290.shtml
   Justification:
      There is absolutely no guarantee that REPORT or PROPFIND responses will
      be equal for every request. Before r1503318 after request we skipped
      recieved N bytes of original request response and continue with
      remaining bytes from retried request. 
   Votes:
     +1: ivan, rhuijben
     +0: danielsh

 * r1504192, r1504505
   Make 'svn diff' continue on missing and obstructing files.
   This resolves issue 4396
   Justification:
     Regression since 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1506047
   Add swig_diff target to the __SWIG_PERL__ and __SWIG_RUBY__ targets in
   build.conf
   Justification:
     These targets should build all swig modules for the language.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1506966, r1511603
   Don't do double UTF8-to-native conversion in svnadmin notifications.
   Justification:
     Double conversion can produce garbled output in non-UTF8 environments.
   Notes:
     Reverts r1485650 on trunk, which was merged to 1.8.x in r1486284.
     Merge with --accept mc to resolve conflict.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, danielsh

 * r1507382, r1509186, r1509196
   Allow passing NULL for the config dir to use the default config dir path.
   r1509186 is to update the docstring accordingly.
   Justification: all other APIs that take a config dir param allow NULL as
     meaning the default config path. Clients should not try to figure out
     that path themselves.
   Votes:
     +1: steveking, philip

 * r1507567, r1507589, r1512195
   Fix issue #4400: crash when committing cp with deep deletion.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4400
   Justification:
     SEGV and Regression from 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, danielsh
     +1: ivan (without r1512195)

 * r1507889, r1507891
   davautocheck: use the correct apxs binary by default.
   Justification:
     Convenience aside, without this patch, davautocheck would use the wrong
     apxs binary when invoked "by hand" (not via make).
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1511272
   svnauthz: improve help strings.
   Justification:
     I found the previous output confusing.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1511353
   svnmucc: Fix an assertion failure.
   Justification:
     It's an assertion failure.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1508438
   Try harder to pass an existing path to sleep for timestamps
   Justification:
     Performance regression from 1.6, reported by user.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1501049, r1501371
   ra_serf: Return Subversion error codes in svn_error_t.
   Justification:
     Other error codes are useless to API users.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     -1: rhuijben (We also report apr and OS statuses, which are certainly
                   not useless, as GUI clients depend on this extensive error
                   codes to provide proper workarounds.
                   This use-case should be fixed by directly setting
                   the right message in the error chain when leaving ra_serf.
                   This adds up to a -0 for me.
                   
                   The reason for the -1 is the re-use of a specific error code
                   that is automatically unwrapped in some ra_serf code, to avoid
                   handling codes like APR_EOF as non fatal
                   [ without r1501371 ]
                   <danielsh>: Responded in detail in the r1501049 thread.
		   tldr: outermost svn_error_t->apr_err should be defined by
                   Subversion or by APR, not by serf; can't find evidence of
                   the "automatic unwrapping", and in any case happy to change
                   the error code to something else if that's the problem.)
     -1: gstein (apr_status_t was intended/designed to hold error codes from
                 multiple apps/libs; check for known values, and propagate all
                 unkown values)
