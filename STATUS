Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12075, r12448
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, dionisos
      (r12075 only) +1: ghudson
      -0: bliss (because the patch is non-trivial and there is only a
                 single known pre-0.14 user)

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.
