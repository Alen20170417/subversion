Candidate changes for 1.5.2:
============================

 * r32409
   Fix an incompatibility with BSD make, which was introduced in r24293.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix. Fixes out-of-tree build of the bindings on BSD.
     Might help downstream packagers for these systems.

 * r32416, r32421
   Respect LDFLAGS in Perl bindings.
   Notes:
     Previously LDFLAGS were ignored (except for libsvn_swig_perl) even when
     the SWIG_LDFLAGS variable was set.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r32442
   Respect LDFLAGS in SWIG bindings without the requirement of the exporting
   of the SWIG_LDFLAGS variable.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r31725, r31837
   Canonicalise URIs which have an empty hostname part correctly.
   This fixes the crash described in #2116 ('svn log file:///'
   results in a failed assertion).
   Justification:
     Been fixed in trunk for a while, rediscovered in 1.5.1 by
     Toby Peterson <toby@apple.com>, see this thread:
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=141888
   Notes:
     r31837 fixes a bug introduced in r31725:
     Take an early out if path is "", to avoid accessing uninitialized
     memory later when we look at *(dst - 1).

 * r32491
   Fix test failures in non-English locale.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever

 * r32494, r32522, r32523
   Fix a bug where previous merges are incorrectly reversed leading to repeat
   merges and spurious conflicts.
   Notes:
     r32494 is just a doc string tweak that hopefully makes the real fix a
     easier to review, r32522 is a test for the bug, and r32523 is the real
     fix.  There is a trivial conflict on r32494 when adding the new merge
     test due to the fact that some other new merge tests are not backported
     yet.
   Justification:
     Repeat merges and needless conflicts in the age of merge tracking are,
     to put it mildly, less than desirable, see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=141832.
