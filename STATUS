This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16903
    Remove spurious dependencies on APR in the SWIG code and build
    scripts, that prevent running autogen.sh --release through to
    completion.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r16903
    Justification:
      We can't release a tarball that doesn't depend on SWIG without
      this, because apr.h is system-dependent.
    Notes:
      Change backported in branches/1.3.x-r16903 to resolve conflicts
      with regard to the altered build system in trunk.

   * r16914, r16919
     Remove unused and unnecessary portability typemaps from the SWIG
     bindings.
     Justification:
       Unused and unnecessary portability typemaps can be misleading.
     Notes:
       These typemaps have never been used, because the SWIG preprocessor does
       not support string comparisons. In addition to this, APR_INT64_T is now
       undefined at SWIG-time, thanks to r16903. I've verified that the Python
       and Perl bindings pass tests on 64-bit platforms, both with and without
       this fix. This patch just makes our code more clear.

   * r16915
     Only allow SWIG 1.3.24 or 1.3.25.
     Justification:
       The SWIG bindings are not compatible with SWIG 1.3.26 or later.

   * r16918
     Don't hardcode the packager's build directory in the release tarball.
     Notes:
       Critical fix. Blocker for release candidate.

   * r16920
     Apply long long typemaps to apr_int64_t and apr_uint64_t.
     Apply unsigned char typemap to apr_byte_t.
     Justification:
       Fixes check-swig-pl on 64 bit platforms.

   * r16923
     Apply unsigned int typemaps to apr_uint32_t.
     Apply size_t typemaps to apr_size_t.
     Justification:
       Fix check-swig-rb problem caused by r16903.
