This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

 * r30842

   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, hwright, kfogel

 * r30868
   In svnserve, tolerate unreadable passwd files.
   Justification:
     Don't error over svn+ssh:// when the user can't read passwd.
     One-line change.
   Notes: epg points out that this may not apply cleanly due to
     svnserve logging changes on trunk.  The necessary adjustments
     should be trivial / non-controversial, but as epg's logging
     changes involved some block rearrangement, the merge adjustments
     will be textually larger than one might expect.  Caveat Codor.

Approved changes (all releases):
================================

 * r30852
   Fix test backported in r30838 but not adjusted to still use 1.5
   test suite API.
   Branch:
     1.5.x-tests-pass
   Notes:
     If we roll another rc after rc4, it must include this backport.
     (The previous broken backport was not in rc4, though.)
