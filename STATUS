This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the the time
being applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are
not core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29155
   Allow packagers to build some parts of svn against installed svn libs.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

Approved changes:

 * r29329
   Fix regression in svnadmin verify in r24559, new in 1.5.x.  We can
   just roll back 24559 on the 1.5.x branch, but that makes svnadmin
   unusable on large repositories.  We must do one or the other.
   Votes:
     +1: epg, cmpilato

 * r29313
   This is a follow on to the already approved r29250 "Yet another node-
   origins-cache-for-FSFS implementation!" that modifies the Ruby bindings
   tests so they pass.
