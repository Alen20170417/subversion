This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.0:

Release blockers for 1.9.0:
===========================

 * r1675771, r1676555, r1676564, r1676769
   Fix a bunch of native-memory leaks in JavaHL.
   Justification:
     Memory leaks are bad. This fix should go into .0 because
     it affects JavaHL APIs that are new in 1.9 and also some
     existing 1.8 APIs that previously did not leak.
   Notes:
     Soak restart is not needed after this fix, IMO.

 * r1676526, r1676535
   Fix working copy operations (checkout, update) with very long path names
   on Windows. See http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2015-04/0105.shtml
   Justification:
     Bug in primary use case (checkout and update). Regression from 1.8.x.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan
     +1: brane (not tested, but fix looks obviously correct)

Candidate changes that cannot go into a later 1.9.x:
====================================================

 * r1674301, r1674305, r1674308, r1674339, r1674340, r1674475
   --config-option: Warn when the FILE:SECTION:OPTION combination may be
   invalid.
   Justification:
     Silently accepting invalid input is bad.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh (1.9.0 only) (for reason given by Bert; not a problem if it
                                only gets released in 1.10.0)
     +0.8: rhuijben (for 1.9.0. Last minute change. Patch tested & Ok)
     -0.5: rhuijben (after 1.9.0. Changes error behaviour. Might break scripts)

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674455, r1674456
   Make 'svn cp ^/A/D/H@1 ^/A' properly create A
   Justification:
     Resurrecting a child as its own ancestor should work, instead of produce
     an error message on a non existing problem.
   Notes:
     Not a regression. Same issue exists in 1.7.x and 1.8.x
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1675774
   Use the /usr/libexec/java_home program to find the JDK on OSX.
   Justification:
     Without this change, we'll tend to find original 1.6 JDK on newer
     versions of OSX instead of the latest and/or default.
   Notes:
     Soak restart is not needed after this fix, IMO.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1674415, r1676538, r1676570
   Fix a spurious no-op property changes from 'svn copy --pin-externals'.
   Justification:
     Client should avoid sending no-op prop changes. Discussion:
     http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201504.mbox/%3C5537E14B.8030303%40syntevo.com%3E
   Notes:
     r1674415 is needed to make r1676570 merge without conflicts.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, brane

 * r1676667
   'EOF found' error when reading FSFS data (issue #4577).
   Justification:
     Without this change, users may not be able to read or modify the
     affected node(s), usually a directory.  While the data is not lost,
     it becomes inaccessible.
