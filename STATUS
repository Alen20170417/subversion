This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10788, r10796, r10904, r10914
    Fix performance regression in character encoding translations.  Most
    noticable on Win32, but impacts other platforms as well.
    Justification:
      Slow "svn status" annoys people, especially TSVN users.
    Notes:
      Proposed during 1.1.0 preparation, but it is too late and complicated
      to put in 1.1.0 at this stage.
      This conflicts with the branch.  A patch against r11308 is here:

  * r11064
      Don't show 'Internal Server Error' when accessing the root of
      SVNParentPath with mod_authz_svn.
    Justification:
      This looks ugly to the users and the fix is simple.

  * r11215, r11264
      SVN has needed a good packaging script for Win32 since forever.
    Justification:
      This and the related build and test script changes will make
      creating 1.1.x Win32 binary packages a lot easier.

  * r11290
      Fix an error in the perl bindings.
    Justification:
      Completely breaks Perl bindings for some versions of Perl.

  * r11296
    Fix 'svn export -rBASE' when the working copy has added files or
    directories that have been committed yet.
    Justification:
      It's an irritating bug with a simple fix.
    Notes: I *think* the code is right, but have some questions about
      the comments in that change.  Since clarification of the
      comments would clarify the general logic behind the change, I'm
      -0 until I learn more :-).  See just-started dev thread.  -kfogel

  * r11364, r11410 (Issue 2076)
    fsfs does not check if the revision is valid for proplist/propedit/etc
    Justification:
      User complaint.  Simple fix.
    Notes: My veto is only while we discuss the other part of this
      change, which creates an empty revprop file in r0 in FSFS
      repositories.  In BDB repositories, even r0 has an svn:date
      property.  See dev list thread about r11364.  I'm +1 on the rest
      of the change (i.e., the first two hunks in the diff).  -kfogel

  * r11394
    Fix javahl bindings not using the default config directory if nothing
    else is specified.
    Justification:
      User complaint.  Simple fix in javahl binding only.
