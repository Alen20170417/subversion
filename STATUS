Status of 1.7.8:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-commit-performance
   r1337118, r1337281, r1337374, r1337377, r1337392, r1337394, r1337485
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
     [JAF] We might want to include some of the subsequent updates to this
           code, such as: r1337403, r1337475, r1337736, r1338059, r1338338.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1341060
   Sort output of 'svn import'
   Notes: Needs a backport branch, noted here for completeness.
   Votes:
     +0: stsp (pending a proper conflict-free backport)
     -0: julianfoad (Nice behaviour enhancement but what's the justification
            for back-porting this on its own without similar for other
            commands?  The log msg says it was done to maintain stable output
            with APR 1.4.6 random hash order, but it wasn't stable before
            that because the order the directory entries were read into the
            hash, and so the order of multiple keys in one bucket, was not
            controlled.)

 * r1394519
   Fix issue #3531 ("Error with AuthzSVNAccessFile groups parsing in
   mod_authz_svn").
   Justification:
     This bug prevents users from defining access rules for certain
     repositories, resulting in some cases in access being forbidden
     to those repositories.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r1237779
   Fix sense of property validation on load.
   Justification:
     Validation is supposed to be on by default but is off, adding
     --bypass-prop-validation switches it on.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, cmpilato

 * r1398100
   Add missing 'prop-mods' and 'text-mods' attributes in the changed paths
   section of the output of 'log -v --xml'.  When these attributes were
   added in 1.7.0 they were accidentally only included for copied paths.
   Justification:
     Simple fix. Seems unlikely to cause harm.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, cmpilato

 * r1390653
   Add Vary: header to GET response.
   Justification:
     The 1.8 serf-only client may fail to work with caching proxies.

     +1: philip, cmpilato

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1398325
   Fix some improper usage of #ifdef where #if should be used.
   Justification:
     Incorrect detection of threading is a bug.
