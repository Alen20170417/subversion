Status of 1.1.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10788, r10796, r10904, r10914
    Fix performance regression in character encoding translations.  Most
    noticable on Win32, but impacts other platforms as well.
    Justification:
      Slow "svn status" annoys people, especially TSVN users.
    Notes:
      Proposed during 1.1.0 preparation, but it is too late and complicated
      to put in 1.1.0 at this stage.
