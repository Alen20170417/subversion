Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r16898
    Restore definitions of apr_pool_destroy and apr_pool_clear for
    compatibility with Subversion 1.2.x.
    Justification:
      Necessary for compatibility with Trac 0.9b2. Trivial change.

  * r16904
    Use SWIG_PY_COMPILE and SWIG_RB_COMPILE when compiling SWIG
    libraries for Python and Ruby.
    Justification:
      If SWIG Python helper libraries need -fno-strict-aliasing to
      compile correctly, SWIG_PY_COMPILE should contain this option.
      It's also possible that SWIG_RB_COMPILE could contain needed
      switches, so we might as well be consistent.
