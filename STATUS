This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1498000
   Improve error handling for inherited property requests by using the
   transition based xml parser in libsvn_ra_serf.
   Justification:
     This maintenance work which usually doesn't belong in a patch release
     makes it possible to properly detect if this request should be restarted
     on non-chunk-enabled proxies.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1496127
   Fix occasional failure of checkout_tests.py 12.
   Justification:
     Spurious FAILs confuse people testing the release.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     -0: danielsh (loses functionality; patch sent with alternative fix)
     stsp: where exactly is the alternative patch?
     danielsh: http://mid.gmane.org/20130705040533.GL3244@lp-shahaf.local

 * r1501199, r1501207, r1502777
   Verify the result of the xml parser in ra serf, instead of assuming the
   parsing always succeeds.
   Justification:
     While in general we can just rely on the parsed result being incomplete,
     this makes many network (and server implementation) problems easier to
     diagnose.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +1: rhuijben (for 1.8.2+)
     -0: ivan (not regression from 1.7.x, destructive change in libsvn_wc core)

 * r1501656, r1501702
   Fix the ability to build Debug Build with BDB FS on Windows.
   Justification:
     Our build system should work properly.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Not a regression and I don't think we should encourage
                   building with just a debug BDB (even for release mode)
                   by backporting this change. That would require using the
                   non-distributable debug CRT. Trunk has a cleaner
                   detection of BDB (via db.h) and even while debugging a
                   maintainer build of Subversion a release BDB works fine)

 * r1502267
   Enforce strict version equality between cmdline tools and libraries.
   Justification:
     Without this, a 1.8.1 client will use a 1.8.2 libsvn_* library if that's
     what the runtime linker finds.  This may be a (hard-to-diagnose) problem
     due to possible incompatibilities in the subversion/include/private/ APIs
     used.
   Branch: 1.8.x-r1502267
   Notes:
     Seen in the wild under 1.7.x.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1502401, r1502674
   Implement the tristate version of http-chunked-request.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-tristate-chunked-request
   Justification:
     Better behavior over the boolean (see the mailing list for details)
   Notes:
     Revisions are actually from ^/subversion/branches/tristate-chunked-request
   Votes:
     +1: breser, danielsh, ivan, philip, rhuijben
     -0: gstein

 * r1502901
   Make ra_serf sessions reusable after a log callback uses the
   SVN_ERR_CEASE_INVOCATION error.
   Justification:
     Without this patch a new session would be required for each of these
     usages.
     Required by the r1468980 group.
   Notes:
     Resets the connection used by ra_serf to avoid having to read all data,
     which is mostly the same behavior as not re-using the ra session.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1468980, r1478987, r1502811
   Reduce the number of ra sessions for automatic merge calculations to two.
   Justification:
     10 concurrent ra sessions open to a single server at the same time breaks
     in certain setups (e.g. xinetd svnserve), while we really don't need this
     many. Opening ra session is still a performance killer in all other
     scenarios, so reducing the number of sessions is a good thing.
   Notes:
     Depends on r1502901 and r1502909, to avoid ra-session reuse errors.
     r1468980 is a small performance tweak needed for a clean merge.
     r1478987 removes a common ra session.
     r1502811 avoids all ra session creations via svn_client__mergeinfo_log.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (for 1.8.2)
     +1: stefan2

 * r1503010
   svn_utf_*: Improve error handling.
   Justification:
     The error chain discards information: says "apr_xlate_open" failed but
     doesn't describe how it failed.  (ENOTIMPL for example is actionable upon
     by rebuilding APR.)  User complained.
   Note:
     This patch is also part of the r1503058 group.
     .
     The current code will not enter the error path in the ENOTIMPL case; that
     is being discussed on dev@ still.  The "Justification" field uses that
     error code is used as an example only.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1503010, r1503058, r1503061, r1503211
   svn_utf_*: Describe APR errors as coming from APR.
   Justification:
     It is not obvious what needs to be recompiled to resolve "This function
     has not been implemented on this platform".  We do the same for SQLite.

 * r1503318
   ra_serf: Do not retry HTTP requests if we started to parse them.
   Discussion: http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2013-07/0290.shtml
   Justification:
      There is absolutely no guarantee that REPORT or PROPFIND responses will
      be equal for every request. Before r1503318 after request we skipped
      recieved N bytes of original request response and continue with
      remaining bytes from retried request.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1501049, r1501371
   ra_serf: Return Subversion error codes in svn_error_t.
   Justification:
     Other error codes are useless to API users.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     -1: rhuijben (We also report apr and OS statuses, which are certainly
                   not useless, as GUI clients depend on this extensive error
                   codes to provide proper workarounds.
                   This use-case should be fixed by directly setting
                   the right message in the error chain when leaving ra_serf.
                   This adds up to a -0 for me.
                   
                   The reason for the -1 is the re-use of a specific error code
                   that is automatically unwrapped in some ra_serf code, to avoid
                   handling codes like APR_EOF as non fatal
                   [ without r1501371 ]
                   <danielsh>: Responded in detail in the r1501049 thread.
		   tldr: outermost svn_error_t->apr_err should be defined by
                   Subversion or by APR, not by serf; can't find evidence of
                   the "automatic unwrapping", and in any case happy to change
                   the error code to something else if that's the problem.)
     -1: gstein (apr_status_t was intended/designed to hold error codes from
                 multiple apps/libs; check for known values, and propagate all
                 unkown values)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1502577
   Change malfunctions to errors.
   Justification:
     There is no reason to invoke malfunction_handler in those failure modes.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, gstein, stefan2

 * r1502909, r1502952
   Make ra_svn sessions reusable after a log callback uses the
   SVN_ERR_CEASE_INVOCATION error.
   Justification:
     Without this patch a new session would be required for each of these
     usages.
     Required by the r1468980 group.
   Notes:
     Reads the remaining data before returning, but avoids processing
     the data where possible.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, danielsh, stefan2

 * r1503009
   Short-circuit the UTF-8 conversion when the source encoding is UTF-8.
   Justification:
     Fixes svnsync_authz_tests.py 5 when apr_xlate_open() fails and
     --source-prop-encoding wasn't passed.  User complained.
