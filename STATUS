This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1480080, r1481772, r1481847
   Instruct clang to not warn about unknown warning flags.
   Justification:
     Newer versions of clang accept warning flags that they do not
     support, but emit warnings about them instead -- making the
     compile output a mess with a warning emitted for every
     single C and C++ file in an optimized build (because
     of the -Wno-clobbered, see above).
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     +0: rhuijben (looks ok, but I can't test or verify via code inspection)

 * r1480149
   Fix a build problem on OS X 10.5.
   Justification:
     Necessary for building on PPC Macs.
   Votes:
     +1: mattiase (non-binding)
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1477876, r1477891, r1478001, r1479605
   Fix a bug whereby a property conflict description always reported
     'unknown' for the node kind. Add a test which catches that bug.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1477876
   Notes:
     The fix is in r1477876, and the branch was needed to resolve conflicts
     (rather than porting prior changes on which it depended). The test is
     in r1478001, and it depends on the test file changes made in r1477891.
     r1479605 fixes an interactive conflict resolution bug triggered by this
     change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, stsp

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)
     -0: rhuijben, breser (merge conflict in configure.ac in r1481848
                           <danielsh> resolved on the branch)

 * r1482436
   Resolve regression in svn_ra_replay_range() where it didn't apply
   the send_changes FALSE flag to property changes.
   Justification:
     The replay without changes mode is used by repository viewers
     to obtain more information about changes. We should keep this
     behavior stable
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (for either 1.8.0 or later)

 * r1481944
   Let Windows compile against BDB 5.0, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3.
   Justification:
     No reason to prevent this.
   Votes:
     +1: breser (for 1.8.1)

 * r1480344, r1480412, r1480442, r1480738, r1480765, r1482479, r1482524,
   r1482528, r1482536
   Fix Ruby binding tests on Windows and support Ruby 1.9[1].
   Justification:
     Running the test suite is important for, you know, testing.
   Notes:
     Bindings changes, so can go into 1.8.0.  [1] Ruby 1.9 doesn't quite
     yet work on Windows, but this gets us part way there, so there is no
     compelling reason not to include with this bunch.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1482829
   Reduce diskspace needed by our testsuite when using cleanup mode.
   Justification:
     A 256 MB ramdrive should be more than enough for running the
     tests in parallel mode, but currently isn't.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1483116
   Retry removing test temporary directories when running as deferred deletes
   using a short delay.
   Justification:
     Without this patch running the svnserve-bdb tests on Windows leaves a lot
     of temporary directories behind, causing testruns to fail on ramdrives.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1482759, r1482779
   Prevent svnserve from exiting when a client connection is aborted.
   Justification:
     DoS against svnserve possible.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben, philip

 * r1482724
   Fix a link error when configured with --enable-runtime-module-search.
   Justification:
     Build fails.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben, stsp

 * r1483391, r1483397
   Fix 'svn diff' erroring out on missing tree conflict victims.
   Justification:
     Regresion from 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
