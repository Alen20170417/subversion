    Fix of the Windows Installer's Add/Repair/Remove capabilities.
    Branch: innosetup-hsuninsfix-5x-1.2.x

    Votes:
      +0: dlr (concept, no testing environment)


  * r14732
    Fix svn-push, which was segfaulting all the time, due to violating API
    not-NULL requirements.
    Justification:
      Totally broken without it. Trivial fix to silly problem.
    Notes:
      Being solely "contrib/" code, this does not affect the soak.

================

Candidate changes:

  * r14736, r14775
    Open access baton to required depth for lock/unlock targets.

  * r14755
    Don't initialize libsvn_ra in svnversion:
