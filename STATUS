Status of 1.8.4:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1498000
   Improve error handling for inherited property requests by using the
   transition based xml parser in libsvn_ra_serf.
   Justification:
     This maintenance work which usually doesn't belong in a patch release
     makes it possible to properly detect if this request should be restarted
     on non-chunk-enabled proxies.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1496127
   Fix occasional failure of checkout_tests.py 12.
   Justification:
     Spurious FAILs confuse people testing the release.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     -0: danielsh (loses functionality; patch sent with alternative fix)
     stsp: where exactly is the alternative patch?
     danielsh: http://mid.gmane.org/20130705040533.GL3244@lp-shahaf.local

 * r1501199, r1501207, r1502777
   Verify the result of the xml parser in ra serf, instead of assuming the
   parsing always succeeds.
   Justification:
     While in general we can just rely on the parsed result being incomplete,
     this makes many network (and server implementation) problems easier to
     diagnose.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1501293, r1501338, r1501360, r1501533
   Fix issue #4390, "parallel nested checkout not possible with wc-ng"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. User complained. See issue for details.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-issue4390
   Depends:
     Nomination conflicts with the branch and merges cleanly without it.
     Branch should probably be removed from the nomination (it was only needed
     before r1503552).
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben
     -0: ivan (not regression from 1.7.x, destructive change in libsvn_wc core)

 * r1501656, r1501702
   Fix the ability to build Debug Build with BDB FS on Windows.
   Justification:
     Our build system should work properly.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, stefan2
     -0: rhuijben (Not a regression and I don't think we should encourage
                   building with just a debug BDB (even for release mode)
                   by backporting this change. That would require using the
                   non-distributable debug CRT. Trunk has a cleaner
                   detection of BDB (via db.h) and even while debugging a
                   maintainer build of Subversion a release BDB works fine)

 * r1518184
   Fix an of-by-one error in the fspath calculations of libsvn_ra_local,
   for the specific case where a repository is placed in a Windows drive
   root.
   Justification:
     Improves correctness. Resolves user reported problem.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1520065, r1520745
   Resolve a user triggerable assertion when during an update a file external
   is being replaced by a server excluded (aka absent) node.
   Justification:
     Quite a few reports of this assertion on the users@s.a.o list since 1.7.0.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1524145
   Make the 'm' conflict prompt option run external merge tool if configured.
   Justification:
     Usability fix. The current behaviour ('m' -> internal merge tool,
     'l' -> external merge tool) confuses users who try 'm' to run an
     external merge tool. See issue #4426.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1526439
   Improve http status processing during commit using ra_serf to improve
   diagnostics.
   Justification:
      With this patch the problem described as issue #4431, would
      probably have been diagnosed months ago.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1527103, r1527105
   Fix OOM with concurrent requests right after threaded server start.
   Justification:
      This was a common condition in my load tests.  Affects threaded
      servers only.  Apache will just respawn a new worker process.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2

 * r1530763, r1530768, r1530922, r1530872, r1531002, r1531004, r1531938, r1532098
   Resolve issue #4436, reverting a move leaves some move data.
   Justification:
      Reverting a move shouldn't break the wc.db state.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1532023
   Resolve possible segfault in the win32 crash handler.
   Justification:
      The crash handler shouldn't crash, but report the original
      crash.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-serf-1.3+-windows
   Allow compiling against serf 1.3 and later on Windows
   Justification:
     Serf 1.3 brings a lot of fixes that we need for 1.8.x stability.
   Notes:
     The dependency handling on Windows was updated for 1.9+, so this
     needs a specific backport patch (r1517123)
