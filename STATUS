This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.0:

Release blockers for 1.9.0:
===========================

Candidate changes that cannot go into a later 1.9.x:
====================================================

 * r1674301, r1674305, r1674308, r1674339, r1674340
   --config-option: Warn when the FILE:SECTION:OPTION combination may be
   invalid.
   Justification:
     Silently accepting invalid input is bad.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh (1.9.0 only) (for reason given by Bert; not a problem if it
                                only gets released in 1.10.0)
     +0.8: rhuijben (for 1.9.0. Last minute change. Patch tested & Ok)
     -0.5: rhuijben (after 1.9.0. Changes error behaviour. Might break scripts)

Other candidate changes:
========================

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1666965, r1667120
   mod_dav_svn: Emit the first few 'svn log' items as soon as they are available.
   Justification:
     A slow svn log makes users call Subversion slow. This fixes the
     perceived performance problem by no longer optimizing just for
     obtaining all the results fast, but also for obtaining the first
     result fast.
     .
     Just the perceived slowness of common svn log operations might
     make users switch to a DVCS, while this slowness is just a buffering
     to make the total set of results come in faster. But I don't think
     there are that many users that really wait for all results of
     .
     $ svn log -q ^/subversion/trunk
     .
     This currently takes > 10 seconds before the first result using
     the EU mirror for me. By comparison, 'svn log --limit=1' takes
     0.2 seconds.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip, brane
     +0: julianfoad (reviewed but not tested;
                     figures given in justification are for a 1.8 server but
                     a 1.9 server should have vastly quicker log computation)
     -0.5: kotkov (could not reproduce the improvement with a real-world 1.9
                   server; see my e-mail to <dev@subversion.apache.org>)

 * r1674406
   Fix implementation of svn_client_copy7 with pin-externals enabled to match
   the documented behaviour.
   Justification:
     The API docs were correct but the implementation was not.
   Note:
     Has to be part of a .0 release because it affects public API semantics.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stsp
     +1: rhuijben (+1 on libsvn_client change.
                   +0 for the JavaHL testcase
                      (this part just tested, not 100% reviewed))
