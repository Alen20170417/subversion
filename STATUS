* r986453, r1029092, r1029335, r1030763
 An even larger change: Speed up file translation by further optimizing
 the search for "interesting chars" and replacing EOLs only if they
 have actually changed (allowing for larger chunks of data per write
 output operation). The third patch fixes a svn_tristate_t comparison
 issue.
 Note:
   r1029092 and r1030763 are docstring changes.
 Justification:
   Apart from the physical I/O and the MD5 translation, this is the
   most CPU-demanding part of an svn export. This patch more than
   doubles its performance. It should also speed up svn checkout by
   the same amount (not factor) of time.
