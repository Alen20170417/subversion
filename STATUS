This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.19:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1144717
   Include SVN_ERR_FS_NOT_FOUND in SVN_ERR_IS_LOCK_ERROR().
   Justification:
     Consistent behaviour of the 1.7 client with 1.6/1.7 servers. (issue #3949)
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     -0: julianfoad (Too many loose ends.  Should SVN_ERR_IS_UNLOCK_ERROR()
         get the same treatment?  danielsh on IRC: "I'm not sure I was
         happy with the error/warning issue here.  but patching the server
         makes the reporting be ehwat the test likes (and what 1.7 does)."
         Does the error/warning thing matter?  philipm on IRC: "Does it fix
         multiple targets?"  Have we analyzed whether the test properly
         reflects real life needs?  Could the bug in unlock prevent people from
         removing a lock on a nonexistent path?)

 * r894014, 894029, 896247, 905705
   Use serf_connection_create2 instead of serf_connection_create so that
   1.6.x will be prepared to work with serf's upcoming ssl tunnel support
   (https over http proxy).
   Justification:
     Make use of new feature provided by the serf library, stop using
     an API that will be deprecated (although isn't yet).
   Note: this change doesn't require a change of the minimum serf requirements
     for this branch. r894014 is the main revision, the others are follow-up
     fixes.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo
     +0: gstein (haven't reviewed these specific revisions yet)
     -0: stsp (not a critical fix, serf is an optional dependency in 1.6.x)

 * r1330410, r1330554
   Fix an error leak in the hook script invocation code.
   Justification:
     This bug can cause a server process to hang.
   Notes:
     - r1330410 was merged from trunk and fixes the bug.
     - r1330554 is a 1.6.x-specific follow-up fix that prevents the bug fix
        from changing control flow such that a file handle is closed which
        was never opened.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-r1330410
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1088602
   Fix regression introduced in r1104127. That revision introduced a bug where
   a URI may end up being double-encoded, breaking commits via write-through
   proxies in certain circumstances.
   Justification:
     This regression has been fixed in 1.7.x and trunk but not in 1.6.x.
     It first appeared in Subversion-1.6.17.
     Evidence of this bug has been reported privately by an elego customer
     who also provided a reproduction recipe based on private data which
     won't be disclosed.
   Notes:
     To avoid a tree-conflict run a subtree merge to mod_dav_svn/mirror.c.
     The revision also edited the dav-mirror-autocheck.sh script which
     does not exist in 1.6.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1338810, r1339164
   Fix issue #4184 ("partial svnsync drops properties when converting
   copies to adds").
   Justification:
     Syncs that don't aren't synced at all.
   Notes:
     r1338810 taught the code to send properties for demoted copies.
     r1339164 fixed a theoretical use of uninitialized memory.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, stsp
     +0: danielsh (maybe add r1339154 to this group too?)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1138975, r1138977
   Add a sanity check to get-deps.sh.
   Justification:
     Prevent a false impression as to which version of a dependency will be
     used.
   Notes:
     r1138975 is the change.  r1138977 reverts accidentally-committed local
     changes.  Note that r1138977 replaces the bogusly-committed files rather
     than merges into them.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     -1: stsp (not a security or data-corruption fix)

Approved changes:
