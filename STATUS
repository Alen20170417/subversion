This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14024
    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.
    Justification:
      Encourages hacking on the bindings, and improves user confidence.

  * r14262, r14359, 14365
    Fix #2049, make autoversioning cooperate with mod_mime.
    Justification:
      svn 1.2 brags about autoversioning being 'finished', but it's
      really unfriendly when (for example) a Word file is dragged to a
      share, but doesn't get re-fetched as a Word file.  Without that,
      autoversioning is a non-starter for many.

  * r14277
    Make Subversion easier to build "out-of-the-box" on WBEL3/RHEL3 by
      dropping support for BDB.
    Justification:
      Trying to integrate BDB 4.2.x in to WBEL3/RHEL3 was too problematic.
      This makes things much easier.  Later I will try again to build a good
      BDB 4.2.X build that doesn't conflict with the standard 4.1.25 that
      comes with the distribution.

  * r14280
    Build ZLib from sources on Windows.
    Justification:
      Cures major PITA for Windows developers, improves debugging support.
    Concerns:
      Not exactly a showstopper for 1.2.0.
    Votes:
      +0.9: brane (+1 for 1.2.1)

  * r14286
    Make "make davautocheck" work for locking and work out-of-the-box
    on more systems.
    Justification:
      Makes it easier to test over DAV; not a core code change.

  * r14373
    Pass all of URI hostinfo to ra_svn tunnel agent
    Justification:
      Low impact; stripping port number seen as a bug by some.

      Yet Another Path Escaping Bug
