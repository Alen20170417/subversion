delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.22:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1144717
   Include SVN_ERR_FS_NOT_FOUND in SVN_ERR_IS_LOCK_ERROR().
   Justification:
     Consistent behaviour of the 1.7 client with 1.6/1.7 servers. (issue #3949)
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     -0: julianfoad (Too many loose ends.  Should SVN_ERR_IS_UNLOCK_ERROR()
         get the same treatment?  danielsh on IRC: "I'm not sure I was
         happy with the error/warning issue here.  but patching the server
         makes the reporting be ehwat the test likes (and what 1.7 does)."
         Does the error/warning thing matter?  philipm on IRC: "Does it fix
         multiple targets?"  Have we analyzed whether the test properly
         reflects real life needs?  Could the bug in unlock prevent people from
         removing a lock on a nonexistent path?)

 * r894014, 894029, 896247, 905705
   Use serf_connection_create2 instead of serf_connection_create so that
   1.6.x will be prepared to work with serf's upcoming ssl tunnel support
   (https over http proxy).
   Justification:
     Make use of new feature provided by the serf library, stop using
     an API that will be deprecated (although isn't yet).
   Note: this change doesn't require a change of the minimum serf requirements
     for this branch. r894014 is the main revision, the others are follow-up
     fixes.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo
     +0: gstein (haven't reviewed these specific revisions yet)
     -0: stsp (not a critical fix, serf is an optional dependency in 1.6.x)

 * r879359, r879360, r953308, r1140208, r1140588
   Allow using serf-1.lib on Windows
   Justification:
     Serf moved to 1.0+. This patch makes Subversion 1.6 handle this change
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-serf-1-win32
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1461760
   Additional fix related to issue #4340, "filenames containing \n corrupt
   FSFS repositories"
   Justification:
     This change makes libsvn_repos block filenames containing control
     characters. Control characters in filenames have always been rejected
     by libsvn_client, but client-side software bypassing libsvn_client
     could still commit such filenames. Control characters in filenames
     can cause problems not just in FSFS but also in dump files, unidiff,
     and possibly elsewhere. It is a good idea to make the client and
     server consistent.
     See discussion linked from issue #4340 for more information.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.6.x-issue4340-repos
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1138975, r1138977
   Add a sanity check to get-deps.sh.
   Justification:
     Prevent a false impression as to which version of a dependency will be
     used.
   Notes:
     r1138975 is the change.  r1138977 reverts accidentally-committed local
     changes.  Note that r1138977 replaces the bogusly-committed files rather
     than merges into them.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh
     -1: stsp (not a security or data-corruption fix)

Approved changes:
