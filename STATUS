for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.1:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair, brane
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1496007, r1496111
   Fix issue #4383, "Subversion 1.8.0 crash when WC path is symlink"
   Justification:
     Crash, regression from 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, breser
     +0: rhuijben (looks good)

 * r1498000
   Improve error handling for inherited property requests by using the
   transition based xml parser in libsvn_ra_serf.
   Justification:
     This maintenance work which usually doesn't belong in a patch release
     makes it possible to properly detect if this request should be restarted
     on non-chunk-enabled proxies.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1496127
   Fix occasional failure of checkout_tests.py 12.
   Justification:
     Spurious FAILs confuse people testing the release.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben
     -0: danielsh (loses functionality; patch sent with alternative fix)
     stsp: where exactly is the alternative patch?
     danielsh: http://mid.gmane.org/20130705040533.GL3244@lp-shahaf.local

 * r1501049
   ra_serf: Return Subversion error codes in svn_error_t.
   Justification:
     Other error codes are useless to API users.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1489117, r1496470, r1497975, r1497980, r1498012, r1499423, r1499595
   Support for HTTP/1.1 reverse proxies that require Content-Length headers
   and deny chunked requests.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-busted-proxy
   Justification:
     Older nginx servers cannot handle chunked requests. This patch will
     keep HTTP/1.1 features in the connection, but will always use C-L
     headers for the length (at a variant performance cost). This increases
     svn's compatibility in various environments. Most installations will
     never see this; the runtime test is only enabled with a config settting.
   Notes:
     r1489117: this is actually unrelated to the proxy work, but it removes
               some redundant minimum-serf-version checking and allows the
               actual work to cleanly merge.
     r1496470: add/respect using_chunked_requests flag to session state
     r1497975: rename config variable, tweak session variables
     r1497980: add runtime/dynamic checking of proxy support
     r1498012: remove improper check of client-side proxy; the real problem
               is within the server-side reverse proxy
     r1499423: fix 411 handling
     r1499595: don't probe when a redirect occurs
     
     Local to branch:
     r1499225: remove SVN_CONFIG_OPTION_BUSTED_PROXY from the public API,
               since we cannot add a symbol in a patch release.
   Votes:
     +1: gstein, philip, lgo
     -1: breser (given danielsh's veto, the discussion on IRC and my email to
                 dev I think we need to discuss this more before approving)
     -1: danielsh (option name is wrong. Those proxies follow the spec, so they
                   are not busted, period.)

 * r1500837
   Follow up to the r1489117 group, modifies the 411 Content length required
   error message to point the user to the busted-proxy option.
   Justification:
     The original error message was meaningless, this patch at least guides
     the user in the right direction.
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1489117 group (logically, not merge-wise).
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, rhuijben, danielsh, breser
     -1: (not vetoed, but depends on the r1489117 group which is)

 * r1500857
   A further clarification after r1500837
   Justification:
     Save users a tour to $SEARCH_ENGINE.
   Depends: r1500837
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, lgo, breser
     +1: rhuijben (but also +1 on not applying it if that would be the
                   consensus)
     -1: (not vetoed, but depends on the r1489117 group which is)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1495329, r1499403
   Fix symlink for svnmucc in svn-tools.
   Justification:
     Makes 'make install-tools' work when DESTDIR is set.
   Votes:
     +1: philip (without r1499403)
     +1: danielsh, stsp, breser

 * r1499064
   Fix issue #4387, svn merge --record-only errors out on renamed path.
   Justification:
     Record-only merge shouldn't be flagging tree conflicts.
     Regression from 1.7.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben, breser

 * r1499100, r1499483, r1499492, r1499496, r1499498
   Allow configuration files with an UTF-8 Byte Order Mark.
   Justification:
     Make it easier for users, particularly those on Windows using notepad,
     which will only save UTF-8 encoded text files with a BOM.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, stsp, danielsh

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1495063
   r1495806, r1495985
   Fix crash in FSFS DAG caching code on strict-alignment architectures.
   Also, improve hash hash effectiveness and efficiency.
   Justification:
     FSFS shouldn't crash.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2013-06/0432.shtml
   Branch: 1.8.x-r1495063
   Notes:
     It took a while to figure out the "right way" to fix the hash function.
     The branch takes all the individual back-and-forth changes and combines
     them into one small patch.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, stsp, breser

 * r1499438, r1499447, r1499460, r1500695, r1500928
   Make building with BDB 6 an opt-in feature.
   In configure, do not warn if BDB was not found.
   Justification (r1499447):
     The BDB backend is deprecated and the check is buggy.
   Justification (r1499438, r1499460):
     License change on a dependency.  libsvn_fs_base has not been tested with
     bdb6, and is deprecated so we are unlikely to test it.
   Notes:
     Two orthogonal changes that conflict with each other.
     r1499447 removes the warning.
     r1499438 and r1499460 add an opt-in
     r1500928 fixes the help string to be consistent with our convention
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, breser, stefan2, stsp

 * r1500226
   Fixes copyfrom URL construction in Ev2 commit editor shims.
   Justification:
     Makes Ev2 shims work for commit via (at least) ra_serf.
   Notes:
     See note under r1498885, above.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, breser, stefan2
      0: rhuijben (Ev2 shims aren't used by production code. (-0)
                   Only by JavaHL 1.7/1.8 extensions branch (+0))

 * r1499034, r1500175
   sqlite3.m4: allow placing the amalgamation in the build dir.
   Justification:
     It is not present in the extracted source tarball, so doesn't belong in
     the source dir.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, breser, stefan2

 * r1488693, r1490721, r1500904
   (Perl bindings) Documentation fixes: document some SVN::Client methods
   and at least list all wrapped -though still undocumented - methods.
   Justification:
     Save users from staring at the Perl source, trying to figure out
     what is wrapped.
   Votes:
     +1: breser
     +1: rschupp (without r1500904)
     +1: danielsh (r1488693, r1500904)
     +0: danielsh (r1490721)
