for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since that is nominated
     separately.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * fs-progress branch
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1146131 group (1.7.x-fs-verify).
   Branch:
     fs-progress
   Justification:
     Provide feedback during 'svnadmin verify'.
     Avoid an API change in 1.8.
   Notes:
     If this proposal passes, the docstrings @since would have to be fixed
     in a new commit.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh

 * r1146121, r1146870
   Fix issue #3957 'reintegrate fails with no subtree mergeinfo on source'.
   Justification:
     Fixes an obvious bug in the issue #3242 fix (r1146870), albeit a bug
     with no readily apparent manifestation on 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     r1146121 is a test, r1146870 is the fix.  The new test only failed on
     1.6.x.  It doesn't fail on 1.7.x because of other changes in 1.7 which
     make reintegrate merges more tolerant of subtree mergeinfo, see
     http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3957#desc8

     +1: pburba, rhuijben

 * r1147882
   Convert (pre-lock hook)-specified lock tokens to UTF-8.
   Justification:
     (zhakov, please fill in)
   Votes:
     -0: danielsh (pending clarification whether it's a mod_dav_svn bug,
                   libsvn_repos/libsvn_fs token validation bug, or both;
                   see dev@)

 * r1148071
   Don't needlessly reparent a RA session to the repository root.
   Justification:
     Prevents possible issue #3242 'Subversion demands unnecessary access
     to parent directories' problems.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba
