Status of 1.7.4:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1210147, r1202132, r1202333, r1220740, r1220861
   Fix the 'svn log --diff' code so that it correctly shows a diff of a
   target file (or directory) that was at a different path in the past.
   Previously it would error out. A test is included.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1210147
   Notes:
    I previously said this (r1220740 specifically) depended on r1220783 to
    make the test pass on Windows, but it doesn't here; on trunk it does.
    r1210147 is the actual fix.
    r1202132 and r1202333 were merged for conflict resolution. These revisions
    depend on the issue #2873 fix which has been backported in 1.7.2
    r1220740 expands the test so that it would fail without r1210147 applied.
    r1220861 fixes spurious failure of the new test
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, julianfoad

 * r1235831, r1236099
   Tweak the parsing of the ssl-authority-files config option to make it
   easier for users to configure.
   Justification:
     Low impact change to help users.
   Notes:
     Both r1235831 and r1236099 conflict and will need a branch.
   Votes:
     +1: gstein, rhuijben

 * r1238121
   Fix incorrect url construction in libsvn_ra_serf when svn_ra_get_dir2() is
   called against a HTTPv2 server with a SVN_INVALID_REVNUM revision.
   Justification:
     Privately reported as AnkhSVN issue.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1200277, r1243694, r1243840, r1243920, r1244466, r1244551
   Workaround for issue #4087, "bogus repos_id in wc.db for file externals"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. Some repositories with file externals cannot be
     checked out with 1.7. Users complained.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-12/0299.shtml
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4087
   Notes:
     r1200277 was merged to simplify conflict resolution
     r1243694 implements the workaround
     r1243840 is a cosmetic follow-up treak
     r1243920 was merged for conflict resolution for r1244466
     r1244466 eliminates an unneccesary RA round-trip from r1243694
     r1244551 uses a better API to query the local repos root and uuid
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1243976
   On Windows, don't try to build mod_dontdothat if building without httpd.
   Justification:
     Regression in 1.7.2 where we added mod_dontdothat to the buildscripts
     on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1244303, r1244317, r1245284, r1245285
   Fix issue #4052, "merge tree-conflicts deleted symbolic links".
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6.
     Users complained: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-users/201202.mbox/%3C36358219FB198140A2CD558823C1A57805374260%40NZURC101PEX1.ubsw.net%3E
   Notes:
     r1244303 and r1244317 add a test.
     r1245284 and r1245285 implement a fix.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, julianfoad

 * r1245738, r1245817
   Say "sqlite:" in front of SQLite's error messages.
   Justification:
     Clarify vague errors, as already done for SASL.
   Note:
     The two revisions are independent.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, julianfoad

 * r1291594
   Support httpd-2.4 in davautocheck.
   Justification:
     Allow testing against imminently current stable httpd.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1292255 r1292260 r1292296 r1292322
   APR hash unordering: swig-py tests
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1291797, r1291810
   On Windows detect where perl is installed and add this information to the
   include and lib directory settings of the swig-perl projects.
   Justification:
     Allows building swig-perl without copying perl libraries manually.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

 * r1221463
   Allow leading "r" in ?p= query string arguments.
   Justification:
     Same as for allowing '-r r42' in svn(1).
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (Behavior change without positive votes? 1.8?)
     -1: cmpilato (a rollback to an earlier patch release would break any
                   bookmarks saved for URLs using the new syntax)
