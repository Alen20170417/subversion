Please review the following patches in this branch.
They will be merged into /trunk after passing the review.


* r986453, r1029092, r1029335
 An even larger change: Speed up file translation by further optimizing
 the search for "interesting chars" and replacing EOLs only if they
 have actually changed (allowing for larger chunks of data per write
 output operation). The third patch fixes a svn_tristate_t comparison
 issue.
 Note:
   r1029092 is a docstring change.
 Justification:
   Apart from the physical I/O and the MD5 translation, this is the
   most CPU-demanding part of an svn export. This patch more than
   doubles its performance. It should also speed up svn checkout by
   the same amount (not factor) of time.
 
* r1029042
 Where possible, don't use svn_stringbuf_appendbyte to copy strings; 
 use svn_stringbuf_appendbytes instead.
 Justification:
   Low risk change to speed up parsing diffs.
