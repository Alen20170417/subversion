This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.5:
============================

 * r34091, r34094, r34244, r34256, r34306
   Various svn merge --reintegrate improvements.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.5.x-reintegrate-improvements
   Justification:
     Prior to these changes reintegrate would not work if the merge source
     had any subtree mergeinfo.  Since subtree mergeinfo is quite common,
     this meant reintegrate was largely unuseable.  With these changes
     reintegrate will work as long as the source's subtree mergeinfo and
     implicit mergeinfo reflect the fact that the reintegrate target was
     previously merged uniformly to the source for some contiguous revision
     range starting at the revision the source was branched from the target.
     These changes also improve the notoriously vague error message which
     occurred when reintegrate was thwarted by subtree mergeinfo.

     +0: stsp (With my limited understanding of merge tracking it takes
               ages for me to review this properly.
               The change is fairly large. I've read all log messages and
               most of the diffs, including the history of the branch
               merged to trunk in r34091.
               I understand what the change is supposed to be doing,
               and from that point of view I can say that it actually
               does improve things a lot.)

 * r34774
   Disallow (at the API and UI levels) attempts to set empty-string
   changelists.  (Issue #3344)
   Justifications:
     The code was never intended to allow this, so if it did, it was a bug.
     But while the current code does not, in fact, really allow this, the
     client notifications claim that it *does*.  A(nother?) bug.

Approved changes:
=================

 * r30756, r32907, r32913, small parts of r32405, r32930, r34794
   Issue #3262: Allow 'svn merge' to merge diffs which add 'svn:eol-style'
   properties to files that used to have inconsistent newlines.
   Backport branch:
     https://svn.collab.net/repos/svn/branches/1.5.x-r30756
   Justification:
     Fixes the merging of certain changes involving EOL-style changes, that
     otherwise fail with a poor error message and little recourse. Fix has
     been available for a long time and accepted by users and just needs
     review.
     See <http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=985219>.
   Notes:
     r30756, r32913 are two similar fixes for two instances of this problem.
     r32907, r32930 add a test for the second instance of this problem,
     merge_tests.py "merge an EOL unification and set svn:eol-style" (#107
     when created, #108 in trunk).
     Parts of r32405 are adding some helper functions in to the test suite.
