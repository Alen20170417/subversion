   * r16979

   * r16984, r16985
     Update APR typemaps to be more portable, so that they will work on

     Votes:
       +1: djames

       +1: clkao

   * r16930, r16975, r16989, r16990
     Actually fix the cause of perl bindings segfault by allocating for
     result_digest, and make it overloaded object that actually reads
     the digest when accessing.

     Justification:
       Bindings segfaults.
     Notes:
       r16975 actually reverts r16930.
