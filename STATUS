This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.6.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.6.3:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r37478, r37543, r37544, r37545, r37547
   Support using `svnversion` on files and improve some messages printed by
   `svnversion`.
   Justification:
     Some messages printed by `svnversion` are inconsistent and sometimes
     incorrect:
     $ svnversion /usr
     exported
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     '/bin/ls' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     'VERSIONED_FILE' not versioned, and not exported
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     subversion/libsvn_wc/questions.c:90: (apr_err=2)
     svn: '/nonexistent' does not exist
     ^^^
     Messages with these revisions backported:
     $ svnversion /usr
     Unversioned directory
     $ svnversion /bin/ls
     Unversioned file
     $ svnversion VERSIONED_FILE
     NUMBER
     $ svnversion /nonexistent
     '/nonexistent' doesn't exist

     -0: rhuijben, cmpilato (Introduces new features and changes output)

 * r37988
   Fix issue #3416, "Cannot add or commit 'dir/@file.txt'"
   Justification:
     Makes Subversion's behaviour regarding peg-revision parsing
     consistent with what The Book describes, and makes all subcommands
     properly deal with filenames starting with the '@' character.
   Notes:
     Doesn't merge cleanly (two tree conflicts), and needed an API
     change for backport. Backport branch is at ^/branches/1.6.x-r37988

Approved changes:
=================

 * r37907
   Make the file-to-stringbuf functions a little smarter about memory usage.
   Justification:
     It isn't too often that we load files fully into memory, but it does
     happen.  When it does, we'd like to do so as efficiently as we reasonably
     can.
