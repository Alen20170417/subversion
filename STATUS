This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.2.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.2.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r14024
    Allow automated tests for the javahl bindings to be run before the
    bindings have been installed.
    Justification:
      Encourages hacking on the bindings, and improves user confidence.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, fitz (concept)

  * r14280
    Build ZLib from sources on Windows.
    Justification:
      Cures major PITA for Windows developers, improves debugging support.
    Concerns:
      Not exactly a showstopper for 1.2.0.
    Votes:
      +0.9: brane (+1 for 1.2.1)

  * r14286
    Make "make davautocheck" work for locking and work out-of-the-box
    on more systems.
    Justification:
      Makes it easier to test over DAV; not a core code change.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad, fitz

  * r14046, r14070, r14301
    Improvements in the testing framework
    Justification:
      Low impact; r14046 and r14070 should've been on the 1.2.x branch
      from day one. r14301 speeds up testing on Windows, where three
      tests run in parallel take hardly any more time than a single test.
      Not a core code change.
    Votes:
      +1: brane, fitz (concept [no win32 setup])

  * r14177, r14474, r14509
    Fix pool usage with --enable-dso.
    Justification: fixes some command line client crashes over ra_local
    Notes: r14177 is the svn_ra_initialize patch

  * r14521
    Make commit unlock files in subdirectories in svnserve.
    Justification:
      Causes commit to not unlock files, but remove locks from WC.
    Votes:
      +1: lundblad

  * r14536
    Make backend tests explict and do them for both BDB and FSFS.
    Justification:
      Complete testing = good.

  * r14552, r14553
    Fix revert to deal with svn:needs-lock property and read-only-ness.
    Justification:
      Revert does not restore read-only when needed.

      +1: djh
