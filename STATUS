Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * 10258:
    Add version checks to, and deprecate ABI version in, the
    RA and FS loaders and plug-ins.
    Justification: Planned, if somewhat late, follow-up to
    r10167/issue #1861; and avoid the need to deprecate yet
    another ABI version later on.
