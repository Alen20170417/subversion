Please review the following patches in this branch.
They will be merged into /trunk after passing the review.


* r985472
 Minimize the number of retry attempts when looking for an
 unused temporary file name.
 Justification:
   Some functions (e.g. svn export) request temp file names without
   any randomized sub-string in it, thus retries may take longer and
   longer. This seems to hurt SVN developers more often than
   ordinary users (process gets killed more frequently) but it also
   makes the client less sensitive to cluttered TEMP folders etc.
 Merge:
   Merged to trunk in r1022707.
 Thoughts:
   HKW: After some discussion of the merge to trunk, I committed r1025660 to
        the branch, and merged that trunk, removing the randomization part
        of this patch.  The tenor of the discussion was that folks needing
        random names should be using something like svn_io_open_unique_file3().
        Perhaps we should look at callers and switch them to use this new
        API?

* r986453, r1029092
 An even larger change: Speed up file translation by further optimizing
 the search for "interesting chars" and replacing EOLs only if they
 have actually changed (allowing for larger chunks of data per write
 output operation).
 Note:
   r1029092 is a docstring change.
 Justification:
   Apart from the physical I/O and the MD5 translation, this is the
   most CPU-demanding part of an svn export. This patch more than
   doubles its performance. It should also speed up svn checkout by
   the same amount (not factor) of time.

* r1029042
 Where possible, don't use svn_stringbuf_appendbyte to copy strings; 
 use svn_stringbuf_appendbytes instead.
 Justification:
   Low risk change to speed up parsing diffs.
