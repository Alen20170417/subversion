Release blockers for 1.9.0:
===========================

Candidate changes that cannot go into a later 1.9.x:
====================================================

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.

     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

 * r1683303
   Resolve a race condition in some test suite cleanup code.
   Justification:
     Without this patch running the testsuite on bdb x svnserve consistently
     fails on at least some Windows test systems. bdb x serf sometimes
     triggers the same problem, but in far less cases.
     .
     This specific test -unlike other tests- cleans up its own environment a
     few times to retry some scenarios on the same paths.

     +1: rhuijben, brane

 * r1683378
   Prevent a possible FSFS repository corruption with power or network disk
   failures during 'svnadmin pack'.
   Justification:
     Repository corruption/data loss.
   Note:
     This is not regression since 1.8.x and change can be released in patch
     release.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1684325, r1684344
   Fix an unintended doubling of error messages in 'svnadmin verify'
   without the --keep-going flag.
   Justification:
     Fixes a bug that was introduced in r1683311, which was
     already merged to 1.9.x.
