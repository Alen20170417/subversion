Status of 1.2.4:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r15888
    Complete issue #1361 for JavaHL, removing special handling in the
    JavaHL bindings for 'svn cat -r BASE' in favor of the
    implementation found in the libsvn_client library.
    Justification:
      Remove work-around, unnecessary since SVN 1.2.0, which incurs
      other problems (e.g. EOL-translations, etc.).
    Notes:
      The merge will need to be applied to the fileContent() method,
      rather than to the createReadStream() method (which is new in
      1.3).

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r14782
    Fix a Perl variable scoping bug in contrib/client-side/svn_load_dirs.pl.in.
    Justification:
      Simple fix in a contrib script requested by a user.
