This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10371:
    Mark python and perl bindings modules "undefined-lib-symbols = yes".
    This is because they require symbols from libperl/libpython, which we
    don't explicitly link to.
    Fixes the python bindings on OS X.

  * r10385:
    Make svnserve CRAM-MD5 work for usernames containing spaces.
    Justification:
      one-line fix, and it's a silly bug.

      +1: ghudson, sussman, brane

  * r10394:
    Make svnserve use repos UUID as default realm.
    Justification:
      fixes 'changing realm' bug in path computation.

  * r10389, r10398:
    Don't always patch the apr-util files for BDB when generating
    Windows build scripts (introduced in r10206).
    Justification:
      trivial fix, avoids breaking the apr-util build by mistake,
      will make my life easier as long as the 1.1.x branch is live.
      r10389 is a doc and utility fix for r10206.
    Votes:
      +3: brane. That should be enough :-)

  * r10405:
    Make sure to use BDB for BDB-specific operations.
    Justification: Fixes embarassing crashes when built without BDB.
