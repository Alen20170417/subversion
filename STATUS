Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12075
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

  * r12100, r12111, r12114
    Fix output of notifications when merging a deletion of a directory.
    Justification:
      It just looks ugly and sloppy.
    Branch:
      rs=http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
      svn merge -r12104:HEAD $rs/branches/1.1.x-r12100

      +1: breser, kfogel

  * r12327

    Justification:
      Loads into an active repository will be corrupted.

      svn merge -r12381:HEAD $rs/branches/1.1.x-r12327
