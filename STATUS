This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r29677, r29679, r29680

    ignored when determining if a reintegrate merge is allowed. r29679
    and r29680 are related test tweaks.

    Allow -c to take a comma-delimited revision list, cleaning up the syntax

  * r29787
    Fix a pool lifetime bug when hashing working mergeinfo that might
    temporarily change during a merge only to be restored if the merge is
    ultimately a no-op.
