This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r31131
   Restore compatibility of svn_client_add3()'s non-recursive behavior.
   Notes:
     This fixes an API incompatibility.  But in practice it's a minor
     problem, and could probably wait until 1.5.1 if necessary.

 * r30746, r30747
   Fix a minor merge range notification header bug.
   Notes:
     r30747 is just cleanup of some cruft that snuck in with r30746,
     thus adhering to my "every commit should need a follow-up" ethos.

 * r30949, r30962
   Fix issue #3188.  Mergeinfo on switched targets/subtrees should elide
   to repos.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba, markphip

 * r31055 (subversion/bindings/swig), r31066
   Make svn_wc_diff_callbacks2_t work in Python (not a new interface,
   it was just broken for Python until r31055).
   Notes:
     'svn merge -c 31055 ^/trunk/subversion/bindings/swig
     subversion/bindings/swig' cleanly merges the Python change.

 * r31056
   Enable svn.diff in swig-py on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: epg, arfrever

 * r31059, 31060, 31061, 31075.
   Fix issue #3157, Merging a change from a path's natural history
   creates self-referential mergeinfo
   Notes:
     r31075 is the core fix for the issue, the other revisions are
     a new test for it (and a few minor follow-ups to that test).
     The addition of the new merge test in r31059 trivally conflicts
     because several other new merge tests are not backported yet.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

  * r30629, r30787
    mod_dontdothat: Allow opt-out of replay rejection.
    Notes:
      r30787 is a typo fix.

  * r31125
    Fix circular dependency between libsvn_ra and libsvn_ra_serf by teaching
    libsvn_ra_serf to call svn_ra_serf__has_capability directly.
    Justification:
      Trivial fix. Necessary for cygwin build.
    Votes:
      +1: djames, lgo, danielsh

  * r31138
    Validate svn:date property values in libsvn_repos.
    Votes:
      +1: danielsh
