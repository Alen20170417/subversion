Status of 1.7.4:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1210147, r1202132, r1202333, r1220740
   Fix the 'svn log --diff' code so that it correctly shows a diff of a
   target file (or directory) that was at a different path in the past.
   Previously it would error out. A test is included.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1210147
   Notes:
    Depends on the r1220783 bug fix, otherwise the test will fail on Windows.
    r1210147 is the actual fix.
    r1202132 and r1202333 were merged for conflict resolution. These revisions
    depend on the issue #2873 fix which has been backported in 1.7.2
    r1220740 expands the test so that it would fail without r1210147 applied.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (without r1220740 -- r1220740 depends on r1220783 which
               in turn needs new-in-1.8 APIs. Are there test failures
               on Windows without it that cannot be fixed some other way?)
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1235831, r1236099
   Tweak the parsing of the ssl-authority-files config option to make it
   easier for users to configure.
   Justification:
     Low impact change to help users.
   Notes:
     Both r1235831 and r1236099 conflict and will need a branch.
   Votes:
     +1: gstein, rhuijben

 * r1238121
   Fix incorrect url construction in libsvn_ra_serf when svn_ra_get_dir2() is
   called against a HTTPv2 server with a SVN_INVALID_REVNUM revision.
   Justification:
     Privately reported as AnkhSVN issue.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip

 * r1200277, r1243694, r1243840, r1243920, r1244466
   Workaround for issue #4087, "bogus repos_id in wc.db for file externals"
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.6. Some repositories with file externals cannot be
     checked out with 1.7. Users complained.
     See http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-12/0299.shtml
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4087
   Notes:
     r1200277 was merged to simplify conflict resolution
     r1243694 implements the workaround
     r1243840 is a cosmetic follow-up treak
     r1243920 was merged for conflict resolution for r1244466
     r1244466 eliminates an unneccesary RA round-trip from r1243694
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1243976
   On Windows, don't try to build mod_dontdothat if building without httpd.
   Justification:
     Regression in 1.7.2 where we added mod_dontdothat to the buildscripts
     on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

 * r1220783
   Fix mis-ordered text output of 'svn log --diff' on Windows.
   Justification:
     Badness within 'svn', fixed within 'svn'. Needed for r1210147 group.
   Notes:
     Doesn't compile on 1.7.x.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben
     -1: stsp (doesn't compile and would need new-in-1.8 public APIs).

 * r1221463
   Allow leading "r" in ?p= query string arguments.
   Justification:
     Same as for allowing '-r r42' in svn(1).
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (Behavior change without positive votes? 1.8?)
     -1: cmpilato (a rollback to an earlier patch release would break any
                   bookmarks saved for URLs using the new syntax)

Approved changes:
