This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r18637, r18662 from branches/1.3.x-svnmerge.py:
    Update the 1.3.x branch with all improvements and fixes for
      svnmerge.* on trunk (17383:18635,18648-18649,18651).
    Justification:
      Contains bidirectional merge support, the ability to remove
      revisions from consideration for a merge that originated where
      the merge is taking place (e.g. 1) commit on trunk; 2) merge to
      per-user-branch; 3) additional commits on branch; 4) merge back
      to trunk).  Additional test suite fixes.  Improved compatibility
      with older versions of Python.
    Votes:
      +1: blair
      -0: dlr (needs some incarnation of r18649 trunk, and could use r18651,
               -0 only applied to r18637)

  * r18549:
    Prevent svn_load_dirs.pl from trying to import .svn or _svn
      directories, which can cause svn core dumps since it treads over
      the working copies' .svn files.  Ouch!
    Justification:
      Causing core dumps bad.  Importing files from .svn into
      Subversion also bad.

  * r18550:
    Educate svn_load_dirs.pl to support symlinks.
    Justification:
      Nice for people using svn_load_dirs.pl to automatically update
      checked in symlinks from vendor drops.

  * r17280, r18172, r18205, r18491
    Upgrade SWIG bindings to be compatible with SWIG 1.3.26-1.3.28
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17280

  * r17333 and associated test case (copied from trunk)
    Fix issue #2306: modification of "svn:needs-lock" should adjust
    the native file system's read-only attribute within a WC.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r17333
    Justification:
      Backport of a change to trunk which resolves buggy behavior on
      (at least) Windows and Mac OS X, behavior which is inconsistent
      with Linux.
    Notes:
      dlr does not have a Windows development environment, and thus
      cannot adequately test this change.  Additional testing is
      especially important given the heavy amount of modification
      which was necessary when backporting the change from trunk.

  * r18114
    In mailer.py:
    Fix bug: named substitutions gathered from defaults.for_repos were being
    ignored for sections which contained a specific for_repos option.
    Justification:
      This can enable extensive simplification of configurations which want
      to put the repository name into the *_subject_prefix options.

  * r18144, r18164, r18170, r18171, r18184, r18434
    and r18037, r18127 (only tools/dev/stress.pl)
    Add support for BDB-4.4 and automatic recovery of wedged databases.
    Justification:
      See above about automatic recovery of wedged databases.
    Notes:
      We found two bugs after this entry was written. Suggest we suspend
      voting until brane fixes them on trunk.

  * r18196
    Branch: 1.3.x-r18196 (-r18441:18442)
    Fix error leaks from non-static functions.
    Justification:
      Simple fix.  Ignoring errors bad, especially from authz callbacks.
    Notes:
      Branch needed to resolve trivial conflicts with r17178 and the
      move of clients/cmdline.
    Votes:
      +1: malcolm, lundblad

  * r18230
    Fix a memory leak in the Python bindings which causes Trac resync to use
    massive amounts of memory for large repositories.
    Justification:
      Without this fix, Trac can't handle extremely large repositories.
    Notes:
      See http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/ticket/2620

  * r18395 and r18404
    Fix scalability issues with svn_repos_get_logs3 and lots of targets.
    Justification:
      Memory usage that scales linearly with the number of targets means
      clients can crash servers via big requests.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, dlr

  * r18451
    Avoid asserting in repos to repos copies where the destination is a
    prefix of the source.
    Justification:
      Crash bad.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r18451 (-r18453:18454)
    Notes:
      Branch needed because 1.3.x doesn't have ra_reparent and because
      the tests have been moved in trunk.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, lundblad

  * r18660
    Be more thorough about checking for canonical paths.
    Justification:
      Small change, all current clients already canonicalize everything,
      paranoia about client provided input is a good thing.
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg

Approved changes:

  * r18539, r18541
    Fix crash with diff and non-recursive checkout.
    Justification:
      Crash bad.
    Branch: 1.3.x-r18539
    Votes:
      +1: rooneg, lundblad, dlr

  * r18254
    Fix parenthetisation in the SVN_BDB_VERSION_AT_LEAST macro.
    Justification:
      Avoids precedence bugs when used in boolean expressions.
    Note:
      Depends on r18144 et al. - unmergeable until those revs are merged.
