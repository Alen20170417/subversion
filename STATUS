This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.4.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20781
    autogen.sh: Purge *.pyc files from the build/ hierarchy after using the
    build generator, so that we do not ship them in tarballs.
    Justification:
      Shipping detritus like .pyc files in release tarballs is sloppy.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb
      -1: cmpilato (this is a very odd place to do this.  dist.sh, perhaps?)

  * r20833, r20836
    Provide named, separate debug information files for clients building
    against Subversion libraries.
    Justification:
      Very low impact and silences hundreds of warnings about missing debug
      information when linking to Subversion libraries.
    Votes:
      +1: djh, rooneg
      +0: dlr, cmpilato

  * r21037
    Add missing APIs for adding a provider to the SWIG/Ruby bindings.
    Justification:
      Improves usability by only adding some methods.

      +1: nori

  * Suppress the "Specifying the language name in %typemap is deprecated
      - use #ifdef SWIG<LANG> instead." warnings.
    Patch:
      --- subversion/bindings/swig/include/svn_global.swg     (revision 21074)

      +#pragma SWIG nowarn=124
      +
       #ifdef SWIGPYTHON
    Justification:
      Avoid very noisy deprecation warnings in 1.4.x, regarding a deprecated
      construct that is already no longer used on trunk.

      +1: maxb

  * r21075
    Makes svn_ra_replay consistent with svn_repos_replay2 with regard to
    closing the editor drive.
    Justification:
      Consistency is good, and this may become important with the work
      that's being done for modifying revprops during a commit.
    Branch:
      None yet, but one is needed because of refactoring of mod_dav_svn
      on trunk.

Approved changes:

  * r20886 (depends on r20833 group above)
    Allow javahl to build with VC Express and fix its debug symbol files.
    Justification:
      Low impact and allows javahl to build on VC Express.
