This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.8:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1306275, and too many other revisions to list here
   New diff support code for added/deleted files and directories.
   Fixes issue #4153, "svn log --diff" on moved file gives "not found",
   and other problems.
   Justification:
     The current code (introduced in 1.7.x in the r1207351 backport commit)
     produces inconsistent paths in diff output (see
     http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2012-03/0385.shtml), and it also breaks
     with the paradigm that the target of an editor drive may never have more
     than one path component (which according to cmpilato is an API violation).
   Notes:
     Please read the branch and related trunk log messages for detailed notes
     about these changes.

   r1337118, r1337281, r1337374, r1337377, r1337392, r1337394, r1337485
   Use the working copy status walker as a first filter to find committable
   nodes.
   Justification:
     Huge performance boost. Especially on NFS.
   Notes:
     Backports the status walker framework. Many other parts are backportable
     too, but this branch delivers the plumbing.
     [JAF] We might want to include some of the subsequent updates to this
           code, such as: r1337403, r1337475, r1337736, r1338059, r1338338.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (I would like to see some test results before backporting)

 * r1341060
   Sort output of 'svn import'
   Notes: Needs a backport branch, noted here for completeness.
   Votes:
     +0: stsp (pending a proper conflict-free backport)
     -0: julianfoad, rhuijben
           (Nice behaviour enhancement but what's the justification
            for back-porting this on its own without similar for other
            commands?  The log msg says it was done to maintain stable output
            with APR 1.4.6 random hash order, but it wasn't stable before
            that because the order the directory entries were read into the
            hash, and so the order of multiple keys in one bucket, was not
            controlled.)

 * r1403588, r1403691
   Expand the scope of mod_dav_svn's validation of client-reported
   and client-requested revisions during update operations.
   Justifications:
     mod_dav_svn should gracefully complain about revisions > HEAD 
     in the update report all the time, not only when doing an
     update operation that doesn't explicitly request a target
     revision.

     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben

 * r1345740
   Remove a cast that is both ugly, and apparently illegal in g++ 4.7.
   Justification:
     Fails to build.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1407597
   Fix issue #4079 ("svnmucc cp rev arg" SEGV).
   Justification:
     "Segmentation fault (core dumped)" is considered sub-par error reporting.
   Notes:
     svnmucc.c has been renamed since 1.7.x, so backporting this change should
     be done like so:
       $ svn merge --ignore-ancestry -c1407597 \
                   ^/subversion/trunk/subversion/svnmucc/svnmucc.c \
                   tools/client-side/svnmucc/svnmucc.c
       $ svn merge --record-only -c1407597 ^/subversion/trunk
       $ svn ci -m ...

 * r1408632, r1408647, r1408676, r1408684, r1408653
   Fix 'svnmucc propset ^/'.
   Notes:
     r1408653 extends the regression test.
     r1408684 adds a missing editor API call.
   Justification:
     Tries to access the parent of the repository root as a repository.

 * r1407131, r1407812, r1408650
   Properly handle incoming changes on symlinks (issue #4091)
   Justification:
     Regression since 1.6.x. Users get unexpected tree conflicts
     and assertions.
   Notes:
     The backport branch contains some testsuite plumbing to allow running
     the test to run on operating systems where we don't support symlinks.

 * r1409146
   Make sure svn_uri_get_file_url_from_dirent() returns a canonical url for
   Windows drive roots.
   Justification:
     Handles a Windows specific corner case in a generic conversion function.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1409804
   Add a delimiter between the two chains in svn_error_compose_create().
   Justification:
     Allow users to tell where the second error chain starts -- avoids
     misrepresentation that the first error is caused by the second.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1403964, r1403982, r1410106, r1410203
   Make fs_fs properly cleanup after a failed transmission of a representation.
   Justification:
     Read errors can create problems for users of the WANdisco replicator
     which does retry requests.  Can result in garbage representations in the
     rev file.  
     Also, can cause false-positive "A previous representation is being written
     by this process" errors.
