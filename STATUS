===========================

Candidate changes that cannot go into a later 1.9.x:
====================================================

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.

     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1686175, r1687029, r1688258
   Fix part of issue #4582, "reintegrate complains about missing ranges
   from node unrelated to branch"
   Justification:
     Reintegrate merge is impossible after the default conflict resolution
     option is applied to a particular tree conflict during a sync merge.
