This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29531, r29533, r29542, r29551
   Improve memory usage and runtime of 'log -g'.
   Notes: r29531, -33 are doc string changes to prevent textual conflicts.
     with r29542.

 * r29484, r29508
   Add progress notification support for ra_serf.
   Justification: Permits TSVN etc to get progress feedback from ra_serf
                  which has been a showstopper for TSVN considering ra_serf.
