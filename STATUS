This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Candidate changes:

   * r16854, r16864
     Expose two of the three APIs backing SVN_ASP_DOT_NET_HACK via JavaHL.
     Justification:
       svn_wc_get_adm_dir() is necessary for deviation from ".svn".
       svn_wc_is_adm_dir() is necessary for WC information hiding.

Approved changes:

  * r16855
    Don't write empty hashes to props file.
    Justification:
      Severely bloats working copy size and causes extra i/o when you
      have a lot of files, but no properties on them.  (4k per file on
      most fs'en.)
    Notes:
      While the core libraries remain backwards compatible, this
      changes the raw 1.3 WC format without bumping the format number.
      This "breaks" code written against the 1.3- WC format which does
      not leverage Subversion's core libraries (e.g. JavaSVN, a case
      that DannyB confirmed).
