Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17365, r17377, r17379, r17403, r17405
    Clean autogenerated SWIG files when the user types "make clean" and
    we are not in release mode.
    Justification:
      - Without this fix, a user would have to type
          make extraclean-swig-py extraclean-swig-rb extraclean-swig-pl
        to clean the autogenerated SWIG files.
    Notes:
      - r17403 causes a trivial conflict. I'll create a merge branch
        to solve this.
