This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.9.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.9.0:

1.9.0 release blockers:
=======================

 * r1663338, r1663347
   Properly record resolving of individual property conflicts.
   Justification:
     Fixes a few implementation bugs in the resolver code and exposes the
     api for more users than those that pass a callback function.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1663450
   Fix removing cache tokens in the ra_svn editor implementation
   Justification:
     Unbounded memory usage and potential access to invalid memory.
   Notes:
     This regression was introduced in r1658194. Reverting this change
     is just as valid as backporting this fix.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, philip
     -0: ivan (prefer r1658194 micro-optimization to be reverted)

 * r1663738
   Stop exposing and prohibit changing internal txn props through FS API
   Justification:
     Prevents an implementation detail leak.  Prohibits changing the
     internal behavior of our transactions via public API.  Avoids a situation
     with the API function call discarding the data and falsely reporting
     success for "set" operations with 'svn:client-date' properties, i.e.,
     with the API telling us that the operation completed successfully when
     the change itself was not applied.  (The last part is new-in-1.9.)
   Notes:
     While this is mostly an API correctness fix, there is a user-visible
     consequence of 'svnlook proplist' no longer leaking internal properties
     like svn:check-locks for transactions.

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1663183, r1663184
   Introduce build support for Visual Studio "2015"
   Justification:
     Unbreaks building with the VS version that should be released somewhere
     later this year.
   Notes:
     Includes a few generator fixes, and compilation fixes of utf8proc.c
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1663671
   Improve obstructing working copy detection in the update editor
   Justification:
     Avoids doing unrecoverable damage to wc.db on invalid editor
     operations in cases where that isn't necessary. Github's
     Subversion compatibility triggers this problem in some sparse
     working copy scenarios.
   Notes:
     This is not a regression against 1.8.x.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1663791
   Trivial typo fix in error message.
   Justification:
     Fixes a typo.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================


Approved changes:
=================

 * r1663003
   info --show-item: Change 'last-changed-rev' to 'last-changed-revision'.
   Justification (for being a freeze exception):
     API change.
   Justification (general):
     Longer-hand spelling is clearer and more self-explanatory.
   Notes:
     API change (can't be merged after 1.9.0).
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, brane, rhuijben

 * r1663697, r1663706, r1663749
   Set svn:date earlier when creating a BDB txn.
   Justification:
     Required for new-in-1.9 svn:client-date to work properly on BDB.
   Notes:
     r1663697 is the fix for this problem, r1663706 and r1663749 add a test.
