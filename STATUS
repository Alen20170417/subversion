Status of 1.4.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r20648
    Fix broken API contract and numerous error leaks in svn_config_ensure().
    Justification:
      API states a different behavior than the implementation
      provides.  Initialization of JavaHL's native library will fail
      if the invoker's $HOME isn't accessible.

  * r20652
    JavaHL: Fix handling of the Subversion client's config dir during
    native library init and API manipulation.
    Justification:
      Ensuring the config dir exists shouldn't happen during library
      init, but instead when using the SVNClient API.  Changes to the
      config dir should trigger svn_config_ensure().
    Note:
      Depends on r20648.
