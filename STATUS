Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or

   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)

 * r1703581
   Allow simple resolving of binary file text conflicts
   Justification:
     Simple usability improvement. Use reported. Regression.
   Branch:

 * r1703688, 1703689
   Fix merging deletes of svn:eol-style CRLF or CR files
   Justification:
     Resolves unnecessary tree conflicts.
     Any more reasons needed? :-)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1704292, r1704573
   Make svn diff --git produce proper forward binary diffs
   Justification:
     Applying accidental reverse diffs might work for git, but isn't
     going to work for our 1.10 'svn patch' implementation.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1704847
   Report both built- and run-time versions of libserf, like we do for
   everything else.
   Justification:
     Easier debugging. Consistency with version-reporting of other runtime
     dependencies.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh

 * r1703470, r1703475, r1703476, r1703477, r1703544
   Updated INSTALL documentation.
   Justification:
     Corrects outdated and partially incorrect statements
   Votes:
     +1: luke1410

 * r1706783
   Really pass patch result to svn_client_patch() filter 
   Justification:
     Without this fix the filter can't determine the result of a patch.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1706983, r1706999
   Add some @since information to config defines
   Justification:
     Trivial correctness fix. Will propagate to documentation.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1708699
   Fix authz with mandatory authn provided by mod_auth_kerb/mod_auth_ntlm.
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.9.2.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1709553
   Fix display of process ID in mod_dav_svn cache statistics.
   Justification:
     User cannot determine to which process the output applies.
   Notes:
     rhuijben: The added include is the actual fix. The rest of the patch
               just avoids compile time problems.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1710167
   Set journal-mode in exclusive-locking mode to improve NFS performance.
   Justification:
     Reduces performance regression compared to 1.8.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1706428, r1706437, r1709388, r1711250
   Fix issue #4598, "No-op changes no longer dumped by 'svnadmin dump' in 1.9"
   Justification:
     Possible loss of information, different dumps produced by svnadmin and
     svnrdump.  Repository dumps can be used for backup purposes.  Regression
     from 1.8.
   Notes:
     Whole discussion is in http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-09/0269.shtml
     (Subject: "No-op changes no longer dumped by 'svnadmin dump' in 1.9").
     The patchset discussed in the referenced thread, r1572363 + r1573111,
     changes behavior of around six different callers, and two of them have
     already backfired with problems.  This nomination restores the original
     behavior of API functions like svn_fs_contents_changed() and switches the
     calling sites of the new API back to using the old functions -- in order
     to solve the issue and to avoid possibility of similar problems coming
     from other places.
     .
     r1706428 and r1706437 add a regression test.  r1709388 is the fix itself.
     r1711250 is a documentation update.  Backport branch is required due to
     conflict in /subversion/tests/cmdline/svnadmin_tests.py
   Branch:

     -0.1: rhuijben (Touches far more cases than issue #4598 without properly
                     argumenting why)

 * r1711346
   Properly remove tempfiles in svnlook on diff errors such as EPIPE.
   Justification:
     Simple fix makes it far less likely that tempfiles are left behind
     on the server.

     +1: rhuijben
