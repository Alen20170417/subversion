This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Note: Because we anticipate a reasonable amount of new development
will still be required for Subversion 1.5, we are for the time being
applying the "somewhat looser voting system for areas that are not
core code" to the entire branch.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r29364, r29360, r29358, r29366, r29399
   Issue #3089: detect mergeinfo capability based on repository support.
   Notes:
     r29358 and r29366 are a pair -- the latter is the real change,
     it just depends on the former for context.

 * r29155
   Allow packagers to build some parts of svn against installed svn libs.
   Votes:
     +1: epg

 * r29268, r29269, r29287, r29389
   Fix 'log -g'.
   Notes: Performance improvements may follow, but merging this is better
     than nothing (as 'log -g' is currently and completely broken on 1.5.x).
