   Ensure that libsvn_swig_perl is built before Makefile.PL.

     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1823211
    Filter standard library directories from SWIG_PL_LINK.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1822587, r1822591
   Make it possible to run 'make check' with installed binaries.
   Justification:
     Cuts 'make check' run time in half for me because invoking the
     libtool wrapper shell scripts is slow (at least on OpenBSD).
