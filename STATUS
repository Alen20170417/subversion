Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r12273, r12393
    Fix simple bug in 'svn ls "local file with space(s) in its name"'.
    Justification: Trivial change, annoying bug.
    Votes:
      +1: maxb, bliss
      (r12273 only) +1: kfogel

  * r12075
    Add pre-0.14 dumpfile compatability.
    Justification: Some very old clients were recently spotted in
    the wild.  And: Dumpfile compatibility is always good.

      +1: dionisos, ghudson

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

  * r12327
    Fix race condition in dump loader computing the next revision.
    Justification:
      Loads into an active repository will be corrupted.
    Branch:
      rs=http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
      svn merge -r12381:HEAD $rs/branches/1.1.x-r12327
    Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz, maxb

  * r12026, r12027, r12044
    Allow apr and apr-util 1.1 to compile.
    Justification:
      APR's compatibility rules means that Subversion will always compile
      against any 1.x version of APR.
    Votes:
      +1: jerenkrantz, maxb, bliss

  * r12397
    Properly invoke ra_callbacks->open_tmp_file in Perl with pool.
    Justification:
      Sanitize perl bindings pool usage and avoid potential memory leak.
    Votes:
      +1: clkao

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r12006, r12136, r12146
    Fix issue 2124 - bugs in svn switch over ra-dav.
    Justification:
      Changes made in the 1.1 client cause 1.0 and 1.1 servers to be
      driven in a way that weren't able to handle, resulting in
      working copies that *look* okay, but can actually send commits
      to the wrong repository location (if able to commit at all).
      r12006: Teach mod_dav_svn how to handle the new request.
      r12136: Make sure there is a versioned entry before setting the property.
      r12146: Work around for buggy 1.1.0/1.1.1 servers by disabling res. walk.
    Branch:
      rs=http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
      svn merge -r12390:HEAD $rs/branches/1.1.x-dav-switch
    Votes:
      +1: cmpilato, kfogel, jerenkrantz

  * r12100, r12111, r12114
    Fix output of notifications when merging a deletion of a directory.
    Justification:
      It just looks ugly and sloppy.
    Branch:
      rs=http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn
      svn merge -r12104:HEAD $rs/branches/1.1.x-r12100
    Votes:
      +1: breser, kfogel, maxb
