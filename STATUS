Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1825306
   Silence OSX ranlib warnings about object files with no symbols when
   linking with an external LZ4 library.
   Justification:
     The core build should be warning-free.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1825709, r1825711
   Don't offer conflict resolution options for 'local move vs incoming move'.
   Justication:
     The resolver does not support 'move vs move' resolution yet.
     The current behaviour is misleading.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1825721
   Convert macOS versions 10.13.x to release name "High Sierra".
   Justication:
     Cosmetic correctness of 'svn --version --verbose' output.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, stsp
