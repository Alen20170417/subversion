This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1468151
   Map missing some missing bits to JavaHL
   Justification:
     A few constants and struct members were not mapped to JavaHL,
     and a newly-deprecated function was being called.

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1467597
   Better error message if authentication fails and -F - was used.
   Justification:
     Nice-to-have usability fix. Explains a side-effect of the new-in-1.8
     interactive prompting default behaviour which could be considered a
     regression from 1.7 (use case now requires --force-interactive).
     See here for details:
