  * r14063, r14066, r14067 (partial), r14068, r14079, r14121, r14124, r14156
    Branch: 1.2.x-r14063
    Fix FSFS locking problem.
    Justification:
      Issue #2265 can cause data loss.
    Notes:
      Only the svnserve.c part of r14067 (add calls to
      svn_fs_initialize) is merged, since only that program can be
      threaded, and adding svn_fs_initialize calls to clients runs
      afoul of --enable-dso.

  * r14205, 14208
    Add lock/unlock support to mailer.py.
    Justification:
      Necessary feature... besides, who doesn't want more email?
    Votes:
      +1: fitz, dlr

  * r14223
    Drop listing of FS modules from "svn --version" output.
    Justification:
      Makes building with --enable-dso work again.

Approved changes (further review is welcome, but not required):

  * r13983
    Correct valid warnings and bogus compilation errors specific to
