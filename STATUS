    Avoid corrupting WC when adding repos entry attribute, or when switching

  * r17521
    Fix and improve help text for property commands such as 'svn propget'.

  * r17614
    Undeprecate the svnserve -R (--read-only) option.
    Justification:
      Trivial change - change one string constant and delete one
      svn_cmdline_fprintf() call only.

  * r17638, r17639
    For compatibility with 1.2.x apps, don't report errors when apps try to
    destroy pools that were already automatically destroyed. Followup to
    r17082.
    Justification:
      Simple but important fix for compatibility with Trac 0.9.x. Affects the
      Python bindings only.
    Notes:
      Prevents assertion failures when Subversion 1.2.x applications try to
      destroy pools during application shutdown, when the validity of the pool
      is not guaranteed. Subversion 1.2.x applications can't call
      "pool.valid()" themselves to check the validity of pools, because it's a
      new API in Subversion 1.3.x.

Status of 1.3.1:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r17365, r17377, r17379, r17403, r17405, r17487, r17494, r17508
    Clean autogenerated SWIG files when the user types "make clean" or
    "make clean-swig" and we are not in release mode.
    Justification:
      Without this fix, a user would have to type
        make extraclean
      to clean the autogenerated SWIG files.
    Branch: 1.3.x-clean-swig
    Notes:
      The core changes for this fix are included in r17405, r17494 and r17508.
      These revisions depend on several other changes: r17365, r17377, r17379,
      r17403, and r17487. These changes are described below.
      - Add "extraclean-swig" rule for cleaning all SWIG-related files when we
        are in release mode (r17403).
      - Clean libsvn_swig_perl directory in clean-swig-pl (r17379).
      - Simplify clean rule handling (r17377, r17403, r17487).
      - Check whether we are in a VPATH build by comparing $(abs_builddir) =
        $(abs_srcdir) (r17365).
      The 1.3.x-clean-swig branch includes all of the above changes, and
      solves a trivial merge conflict in r17405.

  * r17525
    Fix output mailer.py emails for locks and unlocks to use the author of the
    lock or unlock.  Currently, all outgoing email is from 'no_author'.
    Justification:
      Easy, one line change uses method used for other commands.
