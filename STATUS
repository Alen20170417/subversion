Status of 1.7.3:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)
     -0: gstein

 * r1201072, r1205188, r1205209
   Fix issue #4050 "'svn mergeinfo' always considers non-inheritable ranges
   as partially merged".
   Justification:
     'svn mergeinfo' gave incorrect answers in what is admittedly an edge
     case, but the fix is very simple.
   Notes:
     r1201072 and r1205188 are a new test and minor tweak respectively.
     r1205209 is the fix.
   Votes:
     +1: pburba

 * r1207555, r1207808
   mod_dontdothat: contrib/ -> tools/ and relicense under ALv2.
   Justification:
     ASF infra is using this so we should maintain it.
     Stuff in contrib/ isn't officially maintained.
   Notes:
     r1207555: Perform the move (from r1207550) and relicense
     r1207808: Enable building mod_dontdothat from our standard make scripts.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, stsp

 * r1150344, r1158923, r1158929, r1166267, r1206576, r1206718, r1206719,
   r1206724, r1206741, r1207656, r1207663, r1207823
   Fix issues #3814, and #3991, and other EOL-handling problems in patch.
   Justification:
     svn patch is broken for file content and property values not terminated
     with EOL, and for patches not terminated with EOL.
     Fixes requested on users@:
     http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-11/0513.shtml
     http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-11/0523.shtml
   Notes:
     r1150344: Merged to avoid conflicts in diff parsing test.
     r1158923: Adds a cmdline regression test for issue #3991.
     r1158929: Adds a new C diff parsing regression test for issue #3991.
     r1166267: Merged to prevent conflicts in diff_tests.py.
     r1206576: Tweak 'svn diff' output for prop values not terminated with EOL.
     r1206718: Fix issue #3814.
     r1206719: Follow-up fix for JavaHL tests.
     r1206724: Fix issue #3991.
     r1206741: Fixes the #3991 C diff parsing test to make it PASS.
     r1206748: Remove an obsolete comment.
     r1207656: Fix a pointer dereference bug from r1206718.
     r1207663: Fix handling of '\ No newline ...' comments within hunk text.
     r1207823: Fixes spurious test failures.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-svn-patch-eol-fixes
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1220783
   Fix mis-ordered text output of 'svn log --diff' on Windows.
   Justification:
     Badness within 'svn', fixed within 'svn'. Needed for r1210147 group.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad, rhuijben

 * r1210147, r1202132, r1202333, r1220740
   Fix the 'svn log --diff' code so that it correctly shows a diff of a
   target file (or directory) that was at a different path in the past.
   Previously it would error out. A test is included.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1210147
   Notes:
    Depends on the r1220783 bug fix, otherwise the test will fail on Windows.
    r1210147 is the actual fix.
    r1202132 and r1202333 were merged for conflict resolution. These revisions
    depend on the issue #2873 fix which has been backported in 1.7.2
    r1220740 expands the test so that it would fail without r1210147 applied.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp (without r1220740)
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1154121, r1195480, r1208840, r1209631, r1209654, r1212476, r1212482,
   r1212484
   Update and clarify the merge help text.
   Justification:
     Merge usage questions are very frequently asked questions in #svn IRC and
     on the users@ list. We should improve the documentation whenever we can
     and point people to it.
   Notes:
     Merge with --accept=theirs-conflict
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, philip

 * r1215260, r1215288, r1215374, r1215375, r1215379
   Fix issue #4082 ("'svn log --with-all-revprops' over ra-dav
   intolerant of XML-unsafe property values").
   Justification:
     'Tis better to succeed than to fail.  Unless of course you're
     talking about successfully doing evil, in which case 'tis better
     to fail.  But we're not talking about doing evil here.  Unless
     you think XML is evil.  But seriously, these commits introduce a
     protocol change for WebDAV.  I suspect that might disqualify it
     in some folks' eyes from backport to a patch release rather
     automatically.  But the protocol change is (as all our other
     protocol changes are) designed to maintain compatibility across
     client and server versions.  If the client advertises support for
     the new behavior, and the server has such support, the bugfix
     logic is activitated.  A patched client will not trouble an
     unpatched server; nor vice-versa.  Further, the effects of the
     corrected behavior do not persist, so there's no dataset damage
     imposed for users who would roll this change back out of their
     systems (by reverting to a prior release).  Therefore, cmpilato
     can't think of a good reason not to backport the change.
   Notes:
     r1215260 - mod_dav_svn support for this issue
     r1215288 - libsvn_ra_neon support for this issue
     r1215374 - followup to r1215288
     r1215375 - libsvn_ra_serf support for this issue
     r1215379 - followup to r1215375
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato

 * r1220742, r1220750
   Fix spurious testsuite FAIL
   Justification:
     We don't expect users to ignore tests that FAIL.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1221178, r1221303
   Fix issue 4086, mod_dav_svn's handling of POST errors.
   Justification:
     Regression when using the v2 protocol.
   Votes:
     +1: philip

 * r1221463
   Allow leading "r" in ?p= query string arguments.
   Justification:
     Same as for allowing '-r r42' in svn(1).
   Votes:

 * r1221780
   Fix SVNParentPath listings for parent paths which contain symlinks.
   This was supposed to have been fixed by r1132782, but that solution
   had problems of its own.
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben

 * r1222521
   Turn another wc-db assertion people are reporting into a normal error.
   Justification:
     An informative error message helps people more than an assert (which
     in case of TSVN can mean crashing the Windows Explorer).
     Reported several times on users@, see:
     http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-11/0527.shtml
     http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-12/0063.shtml
     http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2011-12/0299.shtml
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1222628
   Improve another error message coming from SASL.
   Justification:
     Similar fixes already went into 1.7.1.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp, rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting; that has been postponed to 1.8.
   Conflicts:
     On fs_fs.c.  Resolve with 'theirs-conflict'.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice) (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -0: cmpilato (For a function with this name, the implementation is far
         too anemic. I'd prefer this be a private function in 1.7.x, leaving
         room for a future public API that really does full verification.)
         (without r1161164, r1161180)
     -1: danielsh (invasive, new feature)

Approved changes:
