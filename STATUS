This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.5.0:
================

Candidate changes:

 * r30643, r30653, r30785
   Update bash completion script.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, stylesen

 * r30883, r30888
   Fix issue #3187.  Fix reverse merges where merge target or subtree
   has non-inheritable revision ranges intersecting with the merged
   range.  Not a common use case, but completely broken without this
   fix.
   Notes:
     r30888 is just a revert of some accidental whitespace changes
     in r30883.  This group changes the svn_rangelist_intersect API.
     If this group isn't backported for 1.5.0 it needs to be
     reverted on trunk and svn_rangelist_intersect() revved.

Approved changes (all releases):
================================

 * r30843
   Fix abort in ra_serf when server sends invalid xml during replay.
   Votes:
     +1: lgo, kfogel, arfrever

 * r30852
   Fix test backported in r30838 but not adjusted to still use 1.5
   test suite API.
   Branch:
     1.5.x-tests-pass
   Notes:
     If we roll another rc after rc4, it must include this backport.
     (The previous broken backport was not in rc4, though.)
   Votes:
     +1: glasser, hwright, lgo

 * r30868, r30871
   In svnserve, tolerate unreadable passwd files.
   Justification:
     Don't error over svn+ssh:// when the user can't read passwd.
     One-line change.
   Notes: epg points out that this may not apply cleanly due to
     svnserve logging changes on trunk.  The necessary adjustments
     should be trivial / non-controversial, but as epg's logging
     changes involved some block rearrangement, the merge adjustments
     will be textually larger than one might expect.  Caveat Codor.
   Branch: 1.5.x-r30868
