This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.1.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/HACKING for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.1.0:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r10310
    When building without BDB, say that repository type will default
     to FSFS, instead of saying that --fs-type=fsfs is required.
    Justification:
      Doc fixes are pretty safe, and not lying to users is good.

  * r10599
    Make the perl bindings testing work before the svn libs have been installed.
    Justification:
      Trivial, obviously correct fix.
