This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1480080, r1481772
   Instruct clang to not warn about unknown warning flags.
   Justification:
     Newer versions of clang accept warning flags that they do not
     support, but emit warnings about them instead -- making the
     compile output a mess with a warning emitted for every
     single C and C++ file in an optimized build (because
     of the -Wno-clobbered, see above).
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     +0: rhuijben (looks ok, but I can't test or verify via code inspection)

 * r1480149
   Fix a build problem on OS X 10.5.
   Justification:
     Necessary for building on PPC Macs.
   Votes:
     +1: mattiase (non-binding)
     +1: rhuijben (but I would prefer a cleaner fix for 1.9+)

 * r1477876, r1477891, r1478001, r1479605
   Fix a bug whereby a property conflict description always reported
     'unknown' for the node kind. Add a test which catches that bug.
   Justification:
     Regression from 1.7.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1477876
   Notes:
     The fix is in r1477876, and the branch was needed to resolve conflicts
     (rather than porting prior changes on which it depended). The test is
     in r1478001, and it depends on the test file changes made in r1477891.
     r1479605 fixes an interactive conflict resolution bug triggered by this
     change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: blair (who has nominated brane's commits after his veto was
                added.  @philip: what do you mean wrong value?)
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     -0: philip (on r1469519, r1469520, no vote on r1481848, 1481870;
                 see dev thread: it's a false alarm, wrong value)
     -0: rhuijben, breser (merge conflict in configure.ac in r1481848)

 * r1482436
   Resolve regression in svn_ra_replay_range() where it didn't apply
   the send_changes FALSE flag to property changes.
   Justification:
     The replay without changes mode is used by repository viewers
     to obtain more information about changes. We should keep this
     behavior stable
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben (for either 1.8.0 or later)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

# 1.8.0-rc1 is being voted on currently and as such 1.8.0 is in the soak phase.
# Changes that are not intended for 1.8.0 should not be placed here and changes
# that would restart the soak should not be added unless they are resolving
# blocking issues.  If in doubt see this link for details:
# http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
