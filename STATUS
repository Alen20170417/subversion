This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.16:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1438879
   Make 'show-diff' at the interactive conflict prompt show nicer diffs.
   Justification:
     'show-diff' produces unreadable diffs in some cases, especially with
     conflicts recorded during merges.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1438879
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +0: rhuijben (Shouldn't we provide a three way diff instead of guessing
                   a base to show a one way diff against based on the
                   operation?
                   
                   I would prefer to have show-diff always work against
                   the local pristine version, instead of sometimes against
                   their or their-old (src-left) version, as that is the final
                   change I would commit.)

 * r1461760
   Additional fix related to issue #4340, "filenames containing \n corrupt
   FSFS repositories"
   Justification:
     This change makes libsvn_repos block filenames containing control
     characters. Control characters in filenames have always been rejected
     by libsvn_client, but client-side software bypassing libsvn_client
     could still commit such filenames. Control characters in filenames
     can cause problems not just in FSFS but also in dump files, unidiff,
     and possibly elsewhere. It is a good idea to make the client and
     server consistent.
     See discussion linked from issue #4340 for more information.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue4340-repos
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: danielsh (restrictions not suitable for introduction in patch release;
                   dev@ thread started 2013/05/10 9pm)

 * r1542610, r1564576
   Add missing description to build.conf, to properly generate a version
   resource (including icon) for this executable on Windows.
   Votes:
     +1: breser
     +1 (without r1564576): rhuijben

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-serf-1.3.x-Windows
   Allow compiling against Serf 1.3.x
   Notes:
     Backport of the 1.8 fixes, plus a few more fixes in order not to
     break the neon compilation which also hooks into zlib.
   Justification:
     (Without this patch the Windows buildbot remains broken for serf with 1.7,
      as recent Subversion versions require serf 1.3.x)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, jcorvel

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1551579
   Fix moving files from externals to ancestor directories and vice versa.
   Justification:
     "Moves should just work" or "be nice to api users, like Markus"
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, breser
     +1 (non-binding): schabi (Fixes our use case, all our other tests pass.)

 * r1555491
   Fix svn_fs_close_root for FSFS transaction roots.
   Justification:
     Without this patch, cache-related pool cleanups may be run after the
     svn_fs_t object has been destroyed.  I.e. even with explicit calls to
     svn_fs_close_root, the user may see a segfault.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1555491
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2, breser
     -0: rhuijben (Seems to be a different name for the same pool. See 1.8?)

 * ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-diff-translate
   Fix regression found in 1.7.15 on Windows.
   Justification:
     We really should be doing translations right on all platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1409804
   Add a delimiter between the two chains in svn_error_compose_create().
   Justification:
     Allow users to tell where the second error chain starts -- avoids
     misrepresentation that the first error is caused by the second.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (I'm not sure if this should be in a patch release and the
                   stacktrace where this refers to is maintainer only)
     +1: danielsh (err->file and err->line are only in maintainer builds.
                   this is about err->message which is valid in all builds)
     -1: stsp (not a bug fix, changes output in a patch release)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1566320
   Allow building with Neon 0.30.x.
   Justification:
     Version 0.30.0 is the latest Neon release, and the only reason that
     we cannot use it in 1.7.x is the restriction in configure.ac.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-neon-0.30
   Votes:
     +1: brane, breser, rhuijben
