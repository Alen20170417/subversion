====================================================

Other candidate changes:
========================

 * r1674626, r1674785
   On Windows: Enable memcached support in libsvn_subr on apr-util 1.3+
   Justification:
     Apr-Util 1.3+ always provides memcached client support, so we can just
     support this on Windows with a trivial buildsystem change. This makes the
     behaviour similar to that on other platforms.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan
     +0.9: brane (The change looks trivially correct, but I can't test it)

 * r1683303
   Resolve a race condition in some test suite cleanup code.
   Justification:
     Without this patch running the testsuite on bdb x svnserve consistently
     fails on at least some Windows test systems. bdb x serf sometimes
     triggers the same problem, but in far less cases.
     .
     This specific test -unlike other tests- cleans up its own environment a
     few times to retry some scenarios on the same paths.

 * r1683378
   Prevent a possible FSFS repository corruption with power or network disk
   failures during 'svnadmin pack'.
   Justification:
     Repository corruption/data loss.
   Note:
     This is not regression since 1.8.x and change can be released in patch
     release.
   Votes:
     +1: ivan

 * r1685085
   Install svnbench as part of 'make install'.
   Justification:
     svnbench moved from  tools/ to subversion/ so it should be installed
     by default.
   Votes:
     +1: stsp

 * r1684325, r1685034
   Make 'svnadmin verify --keep-going --quiet' print errors to stderr,
   as documented by 'svnadmin help verify'.
   Justification:
     Without this change, we'd only print the final error which, in
     --keep-going mode, is just a summary of failed verifications.
     This change makes 'svnadmin verify -q --keep-going' actually useful.
   Note:
     r1684325 fixes test failures with FSFSv4 and FSFSv6.
