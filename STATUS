Status of 1.8.17:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1536854
   Make 'svnadmin verify' detect inconsistencies that will prevent loading
   dump files.
   Justification:
     Some users rely on dump files as a means of repository backup.  Without
     this patch, there is no way except of 'svnadmin load' to know that these
     dump files will load at all.  With this patch, a successful verify run
     should guarantee loadable dump files.

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.

 * r1702299, r1702300, r1702397, r1702407, r1702565
   Handle merging to local add as error instead of segfault.
   Justification:
     Segfault. User reported.
   Notes:
     r1702299 adds a testcase.
     r1702397 fixes the problem with automatic merge and updates the test.
     r1702565 fixes a quite similar segfault with --reintegrate merge.
     The other revisions are minor cleanup.

 * r1706783
   Really pass patch result to svn_client_patch() filter 
   Justification:
     Without this fix the filter can't determine the result of a patch.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1711346
   Properly remove tempfiles in svnlook on diff errors such as EPIPE.
   Justification:
     Simple fix makes it far less likely that tempfiles are left behind
     on the server.

 * r1717875, r1717878
   Make inherited property api consistent over all ra layers
   Justification:
     Our ra implementations should follow the documentation... and should
     be as consistent as possible between each other. Only because the
     caller uses svn_path_url_add_component2() this wasn't noticed by
     our code.
   Notes:
     A test for this issue was added in r1717874, but requires plumbing
     that isn't available on 1.8.x
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1663500
   Fix issue #4557, "ra_serf fails to delete directory containing many files"
   Justification:
     Regression introduced in 1.8.10.
   Notes:
     The associated test is still failing because it was extended to check
     COPY as well as DELETE. Issue #4557 is just about DELETE requests.

 * r1722860, r1722879, r1722887
   Memory access portability issues.
   Justification:
     Not complying to the C standard is bad.  At the very least we
     improve the signal/noise ratio when using memory sanitizers.
     Part of this patch set (r1722879) fixes a crash on SPARC that
     apparently gets masked by some lucky caller pattern.
     Finally, these changes make the code actually simpler.
   Notes:
     r1722860 fixes the issue originally reported on dev@.
     r1722879 fixes a follow-up issue found by the SPARC buildbot.
     r1722887 removes similar logic from the membuffer cache although
              that had not been reported a faulty.

 * r1724448
   Fix handling of newly secured subdirectories in a working copy
   Justification:
     Regression against <= 1.6.x. Without this patch a directory that
     (still) exists locally but to which a user has no access is handled as
     a local obstruction on the next update that brings a change to this tree
     and the local working copy state is broken. This patch handles the
     incomming change as a delete, properly marking a tree conflict if
     necessary, allowing a user to make a copy of local changes.
     (Committing a copy would be hard though... as the user most likely
      doesn't have the rights to copy from what is now hidden).

 * r1728387
   Fix issue 4611, gpg-agent and passwords with a percent character.
   Justification:
     Some passwords don't work.

 * r1745515, r1746364
   Update serf download URIs to ASF.
   Justification:
     Resolves build script issues since the old google code URI is 404 now.
   Notes:
     Merge with --accept=working due to absence of
     tools/dev/build-svn-deps-win.pl on the 1.8 branch.
   Votes:
     +1 (non-binding): luke1410
     +1: stsp (without r1746364)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1683266
   Resolve stack corruption in swig-perl
   Justification:
     User requested fix. Breaks git's svn clone support in some
     use-cases. See
