Status of 1.9.6:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1705038
   Fix issue 4607, patch with missing newline removes newline when applied.
   Justification:
     Silently makes unexpected changes.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
     +0: rhuijben (while I agree that this patch fixes a problem, I don't
                   think this is the right backport. This patch changes the
                   behavior of a public api (with no known users except
                   libsvn_client) in a specific way for this issue. On trunk
                   this behavior change was reverted when a better fix was
                   implemented)

 * r1794166, r1795087
   Search for gpg-agent sockets in (/var)/run.
   Justification:
     Improves GPG socket detection when $GPG_AGENT_INFO is unset or when gpg
     >= 2.1.13 is used
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1794166
   Votes:
     +1: jamessan
     -0: stsp (see https://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2017-05/0047.shtml) (without r1795087)

 * r1795116, r1796167 
   Fix 'svn up' after a directories replaced a file (issue #4677).
   Justification:
     User-reported error that is difficult to work around because more
     "finding the last relevant copy" is broken.  That affects more than
     just 'svn up'.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.9.x-r1795116
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2
     +0: stsp (text conflict in subversion/tests/libsvn_fs/fs-test.c) (without r1796167)

 * r1796420
   svnadmin: Canonicalize LOCK_PATH arguments.
   Justification:
     API violation; errors on valid input.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1701488
   Issue #4592 "fix contrib check-mime-type.pl for changes to 'svnlook proplist'
     output", http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4592
   Justification:
     Make this contributed script work again, after 1.7.8 broke it.
   Notes:
     Brett Randall put effort into contributing this fix: see the dev@ email
     thread "[patch][reboot-topic] fix check-mime-type.pl for changes to
     'svnlook proplist' output" started by him on 2015-08-07, archived at
     e.g. <http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2015-08/0047.shtml> or
     <http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201508.mbox/%3CCALeEUB56NVCR0nCZ2rYki6oKQNcVPPLvWTeCoYyrMqitsov0ag@mail.gmail.com%3E>.
   Votes:
     +0: julianfoad, rhuijben (he says it works, but I haven't reviewed or tested)
     +0: danielsh (not tested; would be nice to have a $ anchor in the pattern)
     -1: brane (Not a valid backport, contrib/ is not in the release tarball.)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1796158
   Fix FSFS f7 metadata recording issue caused by the r1785053 backport.
   Justification:
     An obvious fix (one caller got the order of parameters mixed up).
     The bug is benign as non-deltifying property representations get
     marked as "file data reps".  This happens to be a valid state due
     to potential rep sharing, but defeats that is just lucky.
