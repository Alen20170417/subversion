This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1480080, r1481772, r1481847
   Instruct clang to not warn about unknown warning flags.
   Justification:
     Newer versions of clang accept warning flags that they do not
     support, but emit warnings about them instead -- making the
     compile output a mess with a warning emitted for every
     single C and C++ file in an optimized build (because
     of the -Wno-clobbered, see above).
   Votes:
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     +1: danielsh
     +0: rhuijben (looks ok, but I can't test or verify via code inspection)

 * r1469519, r1469520, r1481848, r1481870
   Silence compiler warnings, tighten scopes and improve code.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Branch: ^/subversion/branches/1.8.x-r1469519-and-friends
   Votes:
     +1: blair
     +1: brane (for 1.8.1)
     -0: philip (see dev thread: false alarm, trades one warning for another)

 * r1489885, r1489928
   Resolve regression where 'svn ci ci' just returned success when 'ci' doesn't
   exist in the working copy.
   Justification:
     Improves usability of 'svn', and of the status api (for api users).
   Notes:
     This introduces a warning/error for a specific case via the status walker,
     so I'm not 100% sure if we should introduce this patch in this form in
     1.8.1 or later.
   Votes:
     +0: rhuijben (Needs more work. Breaks JavaHL)

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved for 1.8.1 or if soak is restarted for 1.8.0:
====================================================

Approved changes:
=================

# 1.8.0-rc2 is being voted on currently and as such 1.8.0 is in the soak phase.
# Changes that are not intended for 1.8.0 should not be placed here and changes
# that would restart the soak should not be added unless they are resolving
# blocking issues.  If in doubt see this link for details:
# http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization

 * r1488294, r1489935
   Add signal information to external program errors.
   Justification:
     Makes it easier to diagnose failures.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, danielsh (without r1489935)
     +1: rhuijben, stefan2

 * r1490045
   Use a unique media-type for svnpubsub.
   Justification:
     application/octent-stream is not specific, having a specific mime-type
     can help with cross version compatability.
   Votes:
     +1: breser, stefan2
