Candidate changes for 1.5.3:
============================

 * r32409
   Fix an incompatibility with BSD make, which was introduced in r24293.
   Justification:
     Trivial fix. Fixes out-of-tree build of the bindings on BSD.
     Might help downstream packagers for these systems.

 * r32012
   Fix Visual Studio meta-projects on VS2008 and allow 1.5.x to fully
   build when using VS2008.
   Justification:
     Not a code change, just a tweak to the Windows build system to
     support VS2008.  Without this change you can't build the C API
     tests or the bindings from the command line.

	 +0: danielsh (I confirm the justification, but don't understand
	               the change itself)

 * r32790
   Fix issue #2505: make switch continue after deleting locally modified
   directories, as it update and merge do.
   Justification:
     Small fix (with test).  User requests.

     +1: danielsh
