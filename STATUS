This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1468395, r1468566
   Introduce typedef for the svn_fs_freeze() callback function type,
   and give it the requisite SWIG/Python wrapper treatment.
   Justification:
     Without this, the callback is useless in SWIG/Python
   Votes:
     +1: cmpilato, rhuijben

 * 1469478, r1469489, r1469512
   Fix issue 4356, status SEGV after incomplete move
   Justification:
     It's a SEGV.
   Votes:
     +1: philip, rhuijben

 * r1469519, r1469520
   Silence compiler warnings.
   Justification:
     Clean builds make it more likely to notice real compiler warnings.
   Votes:
     +1: blair

 * r1469862, r1469866
   Change configure default to --without-apache-libexecdir.
   Justification:
     Before this change, by default, Apache modules would very likely be
     installed outside of $prefix, while still being linked with shared
     libraries in $prefix. This is not expected behaviour.
   Votes:
     +1: brane

 * r1470031
   Correctly set the 'action' and 'reason' fields of a property conflict.
   API users were seeing the wrong 'action' and 'reason' for some property
   conflicts. 'svn' does not yet use these fields.
   Justification:
     It's wrong.  It's simple.  Fixing it in a 1.x.0 release involves less
     risk of interfering with any client's work-around for the bug.  We may
     want to backport changes to 'svn' to report property conflicts better,
     and then 'svn' may use these fields; I'm working on such a change.
   Votes:
     +1: julianfoad
     +0.5: rhuijben (after this patch the situation is better, but I'm not
                     sure if it is optimal. In merge there are 4 trees to
                     consider before we can tell the reason. The 4th tree
                     is available as the pristine version of the local node)

 * r1470738, r1470908
   Tweak svn_fs_verify API to have the same config options as svn_fs_open
   and svn_fs_create.  Make svn_repos_verify_fs2 use it for consistency.
   Justification:
     Let's get the new API consistent with the old one before releasing it.
     Also, addresses cache performance (use same cache data throughout a
     verfication run) and consistency issues (use separate namespace during
     svnadmin verify instead of the global one).
   Notes:
     rhuijben: r1470908 is necessary to avoid a segfault triggered by javahl.
   Votes:
     +1: stefan2 (without r1470908)
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1470781
   Make error messages from property spelling checks more aligned with
   the property usage (say, e.g., "edit" instead of "set" for "propedit")
   Justification:
     Better error messages, better translations, less user annoyance.
   Votes:
     +1: brane, rhuijben
     
 * r1470898
   For issue #4358, make 'svn upgrade' upgrade the indexes of 1.7 working
   copies to exactly the same definition as new working copies have.
   Justification:
     Reduces the number of possible working copies at our users.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, ivan

 * r1470904
   Tweak an upgrade Sql statement to be easier to understand and a tiny bit
   faster
   Justification:
     The old variant had some theoretical upgrade problems.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1470913
   Reduce number of pipelined requests in ra_serf update reporter.
   Justification:
     Partially fix issue 4352: ra_serf fails: too many open files. Reduce
     number of open files during update/checkout.
   Votes:
    +1: ivan, rhuijben
