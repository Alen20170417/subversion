This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.14:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1435635, r1435714, r1435722, r1435737
   When svn update removes a switched subtree because it was deleted in the
   target revision, it would be nice if a future update would bring back
   the originally node that existed before switching. (Issue #4295)
   Justification:
     After this operation the working copy doesn't match the repository
     without obviouse way to recover.
   Notes:
     The real fix is in r1435722. The other revisions tweak the test that
     also triggered a different revision on trunk.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-issue-4295
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: stsp (nice fix, but backport doesn't compile)

 * r1438879
   Make 'show-diff' at the interactive conflict prompt show nicer diffs.
   Justification:
     'show-diff' produces unreadable diffs in some cases, especially with
     conflicts recorded during merges.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1438879
   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     +0: rhuijben (Shouldn't we provide a three way diff instead of guessing
                   a base to show a one way diff against based on the
                   operation?
                   
                   I would prefer to have show-diff always work against
                   the local pristine version, instead of sometimes against
                   their or their-old (src-left) version, as that is the final
                   change I would commit.)

 * r1461760
   Additional fix related to issue #4340, "filenames containing \n corrupt
   FSFS repositories"
   Justification:
     This change makes libsvn_repos block filenames containing control
     characters. Control characters in filenames have always been rejected
     by libsvn_client, but client-side software bypassing libsvn_client
     could still commit such filenames. Control characters in filenames
     can cause problems not just in FSFS but also in dump files, unidiff,
     and possibly elsewhere. It is a good idea to make the client and
     server consistent.
     See discussion linked from issue #4340 for more information.

   Votes:
     +1: stsp
     -0: danielsh (restrictions not suitable for introduction in patch release;
                   dev@ thread started 2013/05/10 9pm)

 * r1536790
   Limit the time spent in committing files with deep change histories
   Justification:
      The problem has been observed in the real world with certain
      committs taking hours instead of seconds.  This patch sets a
      firm limit to the internal processing effort and cuts it down
      from several hours to a few minutes.

 * r1539309 
   Fix test failure in checkout_tests.py after backporting of r1518184
   to 1.7.x in r1538135.
   Justification:
     The extended regression test relied on test suite behavior in 1.8+,
     by not passing a disk tree. The easy fix is to just pass a disk tree.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

 * r1409804
   Add a delimiter between the two chains in svn_error_compose_create().
   Justification:
     Allow users to tell where the second error chain starts -- avoids
     misrepresentation that the first error is caused by the second.
   Votes:
     -0: rhuijben (I'm not sure if this should be in a patch release and the
                   stacktrace where this refers to is maintainer only)
     +1: danielsh (err->file and err->line are only in maintainer builds.
                   this is about err->message which is valid in all builds)
     -1: stsp (not a bug fix, changes output in a patch release)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r1527112
   Fix OOM with concurrent requests right after threaded server start.
   Changes:
     This was a common condition in my load tests.  Affects threaded
     servers only.  Apache will just respawn a new worker process.
