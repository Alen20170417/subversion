This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.8.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.8.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1467440, r1467450, r1467481
   Unclutter maintainer-mode stack traces.
   Justification:
     Code was in flux when the branch was cut.  Maintainer sanity.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, stsp

 * r1467597
   Better error message if authentication fails and -F - was used.
   Justification:
     Nice-to-have usability fix. Explains a side-effect of the new-in-1.8
     interactive prompting default behaviour which could be considered a
     regression from 1.7 (use case now requires --force-interactive).
     See here for details:

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================

Approved changes:
=================

 * 1.8.x-svn_fs_info-removal
   Remove an API that is #define'd away and not compiled, as well as
   fs-loader.h parts of it.
   Justification:
     Deleting dead code.  Will be released in 1.9x.
   Branch: 1.8.x-svn_fs_info-removal
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh, stsp, rhuijben

 * r1467675
   Add missing Doxygen @since marker to svn_auth_forget_credentials().
   Justification:
     Friendliness to API consumers.
   Notes:
     I didn't check whether other related APIs are also missing @since tags.
