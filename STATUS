================

Candidate changes:

   Fix issue 767: Commit uses temporary file in current directory.
   Remark:
     Commits in read-only directories therefore fail.  This revision adds
     graceful fallback.

    Make svn info not error out on paths that don't exist in future revs.

      Regression with a simple fix; affects TSVN.
    Notes:
