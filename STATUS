This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.3.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.3.0:
================

Soak period:
  2005-11-30 - Begun with public announcement of rc4.
  2005-12-21 - Final week commences - critical backports only.
  2005-12-28 - Soak period elapsed!

Blocker:

  Wording specifically mentioning 'the plan for 1.3' is in the template
  post-lock and post-unlock hooks.  This would look ridiculous in a final
  1.3 release.
