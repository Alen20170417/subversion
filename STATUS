Status of 1.1.2:
================

Candidate changes:

  * r11483 (Issue #2091)
    Unitialized variable on Win98.
    Justification:
      It was causing random failures for our Win98 users.  The fix
      also correctly sets the locale path now, making locale stuff
      work as well.
    Notes: Change looks good to me.  I can't in good conscience +1
      it only because I don't have the environment to test nor the
      docs to review the MultiByteToWideChar() call.  -kfogel

  * r11439, r11669
    Fix slow "svn st" where the targets are files by not locking the whole
    anchor tree.

      +1: lundblad, dionisos, ghudson
      (r11439 nominated by): Steve King

  * r11665
    Make FSFS commits work with insert-only perms on db/revs.
    Justification:
      This is a pretty straightforward order-of-operations change, is
      how I (Greg) always intended FSFS to work, and fulfills what has
      been a secondary goal of FSFS from the beginning.

  * Issue #2111
    Fix RPM build breakage.
    Justification:
      RPM build breakage = bad.

      +1: david, ghudson

  * r11047 (Issue #2032)
    Always call mkdir-init, even if we're not in a VPATH setup.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL without manually creating
      directories to work around Issue #2032.
    Votes:
      +1: dlr, ghudson
      Nominated by: David James <james82@gmail.com>

  * r11050
    Add install dependencies for libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_base.
    Justification:
      Allows users to install JavaHL separately, without needing to
      compile and install the base subversion package.  Without this
      fix, JavaHL installation crashes in that case.

  * r11685
    Internationalization issues for the Windows Installer
    Justification:
      Keeping the installer in sync with actual 1.1.x Windows build.
      The Apache Server will not run on some systems w/o this merge.

  * r11708
    Fix a bug which caused certain unfinished switch operations to leave
    the working copy in a busticated state.
    Justification:
      Did you miss the part where I said "working copy ... busticated state"?

  * r11730, r11743 (Issue #2108)
    Fix UNC paths on Cygwin.

  * r11740
    Fix encoding bug in svn ls -v.

  * r12046
    Fix issue 2142 - svndumpfilter mislabels output as version 3.
    Justification:
      Prevents chaining of multiple svndumpfilter runs.
      (This is a regression from 1.0.x)
      Trivial change.
