This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.7.x line.

See http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/releasing.html#release-stabilization
for details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.

Status of 1.7.0:

Candidate changes:
==================

 * r1146131 and followups
   Add svn_fs_verify() and implement rep-cache verification in FSFS using it.
   Branch:
     1.7.x-fs-verify
   Justification:
     Would be nice to extend verify already in 1.7.x.
   Notes:
     This does not include progress reporting, since that is nominated
     separately.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: danielsh
     +0: gstein (progress would be nice)

 * fs-progress branch
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1146131 group (1.7.x-fs-verify).
   Branch:
     fs-progress
   Justification:
     Provide feedback during 'svnadmin verify'.
     Avoid an API change in 1.8.
   Notes:
     If this proposal passes, the docstrings @since would have to be fixed
     in a new commit.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh

 * r1147540, r1147541
   Remove unused variables in build system.
   Justification:
     Backporting of future changes will be easier.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: stsp (we can backport these when we need to)

 * r1148083, r1148094
   Preload libsvn_auth_gnome_keyring and libsvn_auth_kwallet in locally built
   executables.
   Justification:
     Version mismatch errors would occur during trying to use locally built
     executables when a different version of Subversion was installed
     in /usr/lib.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever, philip

 * r1148992
   Print error messages about failures of dynamic loading of libraries when
   SVN_DEBUG_DSO is defined instead of never.
   Justification:
     Suboptimal r1148374 was already backported in r1148488.
   Votes:
     +1: arfrever
     -0: rhuijben (A library shouldn't just write things to stderr. This needs
                   proper error handling instead. And besides I doubt anyone is
                   going to use this define (No veto!))
     -0: philip (changed my mind, I don't think this is needed on the branch)
     -0: stsp (Arfrever, can you please explain precisely what use case you
               have for this code? Why do you need it in the release, or
               on trunk, for that matter?)

 * r1148043, r1151055
   Allow building with serf trunk on windows.
   Votes:
     +0: danielsh (r1151055 only)
     +1: pburba, rhuijben
     -0: gstein (the serf 2.x API will be incompatible with 1.7.x, so this
         will never be useful)

 * r1154278, r1154379, r1154382
   Make 'svn ls' capable of listing Subversion 1.0-1.3 repositories using
   ra_serf.
   Justification:
     We promised not to break backwards compatibility and it is not nice
     that serf doesn't want to list the neon repository.
     (Check svn ls http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon/)
   Notes:
     r1154278 is a quick hack to detect old servers and to at least return
              some information.
     r1154379 is the real fix: fallback to a more compatible request.
     r1154382 makes sure the right result is used directly after falling
              back from svn_ra_serf__get_dir.
              (Most likely the problem is detected earlier than this function)
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben

 * r1155160
   When serf restarts a web request, start parsing xml where we stopped in the
   previous request to avoid xml parse errors on the <?xml.
   Justification:
     Without this patch it is not possible to reliable checkout neon using
     serf. (svn co http://svn.webdav.org/repos/projects/neon/tags/0.29.6 wc).
     I (rhuijben) call that a regression.
   Branch:
     ^/subversion/branches/1.7.x-r1155160
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben
     +0: stsp, cmpilato (Without branch: Change looks good, but there is a
                         merge conflict. Please create a backport branch.)

 * r1158187, r1158196, r1158201, r1158207
   Fix issues #2557 and #3987: 'svn info symlink/to/wc'.
   Justification:
     That syntax should work.
   Notes:
     Depends on the r1158193 group.
   Votes:
     +1: danielsh (without r1158187)
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

 * r1158616
   Recreate missing directories on file install errors.
   Justification:
     Trivial patch that fixes a variable reference in a patch that should have
     handled a common user problem. The result is improved the svn cleanup
     stability.
   Votes:
     +1: rhuijben, cmpilato

Veto-blocked changes:
=====================
