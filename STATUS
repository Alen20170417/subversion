 * r1820778
   Make mod_dav_svn report commit capabilities based on SVNMasterVersion.
   Justification:
     Allows 1.10 write-through proxy to 1.9 master.
   Votes:
     +1: philip
   Notes:
     I believe this is a release blocker, without it we break backward
     compatibilty for write-through proxies.

   Tweaks to doc strings and Doxygen mark-up of 1.10 API changes.
