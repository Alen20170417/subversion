This file tracks the status of releases in the 1.5.x line.

See "Stabilizing and maintaining releases" in trunk/www/hacking.html for
details on how release lines and voting work, what kinds of bugs can
delay a release, etc.


Candidate changes for 1.5.5:
============================

 * r34091, r34094, r34244, r34256, r34306
   Various svn merge --reintegrate improvements.
   Branch:
     ^/branches/1.5.x-reintegrate-improvements
   Justification:
     Prior to these changes reintegrate would not work if the merge source
     had any subtree mergeinfo.  Since subtree mergeinfo is quite common,
     this meant reintegrate was largely unuseable.  With these changes
     reintegrate will work as long as the source's subtree mergeinfo and
     implicit mergeinfo reflect the fact that the reintegrate target was
     previously merged uniformly to the source for some contiguous revision
     range starting at the revision the source was branched from the target.
     These changes also improve the notoriously vague error message which
     occurred when reintegrate was thwarted by subtree mergeinfo.

     +0: stsp (With my limited understanding of merge tracking it takes
               ages for me to review this properly.
               The change is fairly large. I've read all log messages and
               most of the diffs, including the history of the branch
               merged to trunk in r34091.
               I understand what the change is supposed to be doing,
               and from that point of view I can say that it actually
               does improve things a lot.)
     -1: julianfoad (Don't panic, we just need to check what's wrong with the
           error reporting. In some merge attempts it throws the "error"
           "200 OK" with no further explanation. See email thread
           <http://subversion.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsForumId=462&dsMessageId=986670>.)

Approved changes:
=================

 * r34774
   Disallow (at the API and UI levels) attempts to set empty-string
   changelists.  (Issue #3344)
   Justifications:
     The code was never intended to allow this, so if it did, it was a bug.
     But while the current code does not, in fact, really allow this, the
     client notifications claim that it *does*.  A(nother?) bug.
