BUILDING CSVN
-------------

Before building csvn, first verify that you have all the required software
installed:

  - Python 2.3 or later
  - ctypes 1.0 or later (NOTE: ctypes is included by default with Python 2.5)
  - Subversion 1.4.3 or later (including header files)
  - APR and APR-util (including header files, and the
                      apr-1-config / apr-config script)

Next, checkout the latest version of ctypesgen from
http://code.google.com/p/ctypesgen/ to a "ctypesgen" subdirectory under
the ctypes python bindings.

For example:
   $ svn co http://ctypesgen.googlecode.com/svn/trunk ctypesgen

Once you have all of the above software installed, you can build the
ctypes Python bindings by running "python autogen.py".

You can test the bindings by running test/run_all.py. The output of
test/run_all.py should look something like this:

   $ python test/run_all.py

   ..........................
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Ran 26 tests in 51.456s

   OK

You can also test the bindings by running the example.py script.

The output of example.py should look something like this:

    $ python example.py
