BUILDING CSVN
-------------

Before building csvn, first verify that you have all the required software
installed:

  - Python 2.3 or later
  - ctypes 1.0 or later (NOTE: ctypes is included by default with Python 2.5)
  - Subversion 1.4.3 or later (including header files)
  - APR and APR-util (including header files, and the
                      apr-1-config / apr-config script)

Once you have all of the above software installed, you can build the
ctypes Python bindings by running "python autogen.py". If that works,
then you can test the bindings by running the example.py script.

The output of example.py should look something like this:

    $ python example.py
