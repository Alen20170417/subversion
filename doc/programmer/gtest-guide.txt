0. Introduction
----------------
Googletest is an external package that is downloaded and
compiled on request, as part of a regular compilations.

From the Googletest Project page:
"Google's framework for writing C++ tests on a variety of platforms
(Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Cygwin, Windows CE, and Symbian). Based on
the xUnit architecture. Supports automatic test discovery, a rich set
of assertions, user-defined assertions, death tests, fatal and
non-fatal failures, value- and type-parameterized tests, various
options for running the tests, and XML test report generation."

1. Setting up 
--------------

To configure Subversion to use Googletest, type

./get-dep.sh gtest
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-gtest <your other options here>

this sets up gtest in the /trunk/libgtest directory.

Note that currently autogen.sh issues header warnings and the
configure script prints spurious errormessages of the form ""the
option --enable-gtest is not recognised."

Please ignore them, this does not interfere with the functionality of
Googletest at all, and everything is being installed correctly.
