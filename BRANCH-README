PURPOSE:
--------

This branch explores the ramifications of not setting mergeinfo on
subtrees unaffected by a merge.  For specifics see
notes/subtree-mergeinfo/overview.txt

WHY A BRANCH?
-------------

This work is living on a branch for now because it may prove fruitless
if it cripples merge performance and because it changes mergeinfo recording
behavior in such a way as to make *many* tests fail (and I'd rather get the
new behavior dialed-in before spending a lot of time tweaking test
expectations).

BRANCH STYLE:
-------------

I am keeping this branch in sync with trunk in the event it is reintegrated.
