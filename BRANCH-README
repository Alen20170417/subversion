svn_mutex__t is supposed to be an almost zero-overhead
wrapper around apr_thread_mutex_t. And if it wasn't for
the 1.7 stabilization, this change would be developed
directly on /trunk.

The basic idea is to move code patterns like

#if APR_HAS_THREADS
  if (my_struct->mutex)
    {
      status = apr_thread_mutex_lock(my_struct->mutex);
      if (status)
        return svn_error_wrap_apr(...)
    }
#endif

into a dedicated function such that callers may simply do

  SVN_ERR(svn_mutex__lock(my_struct->mutex));
