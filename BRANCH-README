This branch is for the development of changes related to Subversion
issue #2028[1], namely the redefinition of "uri" from an API
perspective to include onto absolute URLs.  The desired outcome is
that Subversion will speak consistently in terms of absolute base
paths (absolute URLs in the RA layers, absolute dirents in the WC
layer, etc.) and paths relative to those.

Because the use of the path APIs in Subversion is so ubiquitous, this
branch will be kept in sync with the 'trunk' -- handling conflicts
here as they occur -- with an eye on eventual reintegration.

This branch is *NOT* guaranteed to build.  In fact, compilation errors
are being intentionally used as cheap pointers to code that needs to
be examined in light of the desired functionality.
