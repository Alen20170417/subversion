Purpose
-------

The goal of this branch is to (re-)implement revprop caching
for FSFS.  This will require some additional infrastructure
to communicate changes to all server processes:

There has been an attempt to implement this feature directly
on /trunk but further investigation identified various issues
with it, see this thread:

ToDo List
---------

* re-apply original patches (done)
* implement svn_named_atomic API (in progress)
* provide tests for the new API
* switch revprop generation storage from file to new API
* introduce new option to enable revprop caching selectively
  (instead of piggybacking it onto the fulltext caching option)
