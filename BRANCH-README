This branch is for the development of changes related to Subversion
issue #2028[1], namely the redefinition of "uri" from an API
perspective to include onto absolute URLs.  The desired outcome is
that Subversion will speak consistently in terms of absolute base
paths (absolute URLs in the RA layers, absolute dirents in the WC
layer, etc.) and paths relative to those.

Because the use of the path APIs in Subversion is so ubiquitous, this
branch will be kept in sync with the 'trunk' -- handling conflicts
here as they occur -- with an eye on eventual reintegration.

========
THE PLAN
========

Step 1:  [DONE]

   Rename all svn_uri_* functions to svn_url_*.  This will allow the
   compiler to help identify unreviewed code, including any new
   introductions via sync merges with the trunk.

Step 2:  [DONE]

   Review svn_url_* functions for correctness/relevance:

   svn_url_is_absolute [DONE]

      Remove.  All URLs will be absolute by definition.

   svn_url_join [DONE]

      Replace with svn_url_join_relpath().
   
   svn_url_dirname [DONE]
   svn_url_get_longest_ancestor [DONE]
   svn_url_is_ancestor [DONE]
   svn_url_skip_ancestor [DONE]
   svn_url_condense_targets [DONE]
   svn_url_split [DONE]
   svn_url_basename [DONE]
   svn_url_is_child [DONE]

      Remove code that accepts non-URL URIs (asserting that input is
      valid).

   svn_url_is_canonical [DONE]

      Remove code that accepts non-URL URIs (asserting that input is
      valid).
   
   svn_url_canonicalize [DONE]

      Assert that we have something vaguely URL-ish to even work with.
   
   svn_url_get_dirent_from_file_url [DONE]
   svn_url_get_file_url_from_dirent [DONE]

      Expect nothing will change here.
   
   svn_url_is_root [DONE]

      This says it's not to be used with URLs, but why not?  Make it
      handle URLs.

Step 3:

   Return URI-decoded relpaths (instead of URI-encoded ones) from some
   of these APIs:

      svn_url_basename [DONE]
      svn_url_condense_targets [DONE]
      svn_url_is_child [DONE]
      svn_url_split [DONE]

   Make svn_url_join_relpath() URI-encode its input relpath.

Step 4:

   Rename svn_url_* back to svn_uri_*.
