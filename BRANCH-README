A branch on which to try out move-tracking designs.

Merge policy:

  Development branch -- periodic catch-up merges from trunk.

  The work on this branch may or may not eventually be wanted on trunk. It
  is not intended to be kept in a state where it could be merged to trunk.


Work on this branch:

  * Develop a 'commit editor' interface supporting moves.

    See subversion/include/private/svn_editor3.h

    STATUS

    This looks like it's panning out OK.

    Two versions are declared (in the same struct): 'incremental' and
    'independent per-node changes'. Need eventually to choose one and
    lose the other. It's not a question of one's right and one's wrong;
    both are correct. I think the 'independent per-node changes' one is
    ultimately better and easier to use, while the 'incremental' one is
    easier to start using when we're starting from an Ev1 code base.

    Ev1->Ev3->Ev1 shims are written, using the 'incremental' API. Tests
    pass with double-shim conversions at RA layer and repos layer. (One
    svnlook test fails due to svnlook reporting a no-op change as a
    change.)

    Not tested with moves -- unit tests need to be written. (I complained
    that Ev2 was not tested with moves, but the difference is I can
    understand the way Ev3 is designed to handle moves.)


  * Adapt the editor as necessary to use as an 'update editor'.

    The 'update editor' has some significantly different requirements,
    at least the way it's implemented today with WC paths being
    communicated rather than repository paths/nodes. Need to work out
    how best to achieve this.
    My preference is to lean towards using a 'tree editor' working on
    repos nodes, and let the client side convert these to WC paths, but
    we'll have to see if that's practical.

    STATUS

    Not started.


  * 'update', 'diff', 'merge', ...

    STATUS

    Needs design.


Notes:

  Naming: 'Ev3'/'svn_editor3_t' is a temporary name. It should end up
  replacing Ev2 and so should be called 'Ev2'/'svn_editor_t' then.
