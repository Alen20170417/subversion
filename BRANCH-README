This is a development branch, intended for prototyping ideas around move
tracking, with an emphasis on the client side and how move information can
be used in merging.

The branch should be maintained with catch-up merges from trunk.

The branch should NOT be merged back to trunk.

The code on this branch should build but need not pass testing at all times.

Everything documented here is subject to change from time to time.


== Main Goals ==

  * Discover which APIs and API concepts will be affected by move tracking:
    which need to be modified to maintain backward compatibility, and which
    need to be extended to handle moves.  See
    <http://wiki.apache.org/subversion/MergeDev/ApiChangesForMove>.

  * Establish how to feed move information into diff and merge.

  * Keep backward compatibility.


== Non-Goals for This Branch ==

  * FSFS storage format.

  * APIs at libsvn_repos, libsvn_fs and libsvn_fs_fs.

  * Wire protocols.

  * A new merge algorithm.


== Tasks and Changes ==

  * Implement simple move tracking in FSFS, sufficient to provide move
    information on demand.  (An alternative would be to implement heuristic
    move detection.) [STARTED]

  * Create a tree-diff representation to include move information.  Perhaps
    based on svn_diff_tree_processor_t, svn_delta_editor_t or Ev2.  The move
    information may be in the form of a list of matching node pairs.
