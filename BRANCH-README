The purpose of this [fsfs-ucsnorm] branch is to implement two optional
checks related to Unicode normalisation to FSFS.


Option: Prevent name collisions
===============================

If this option is enabled, FSFS will reject operations that would
create two different representations of the same name in the same
directory. This will prevent situations where a user could see more
than one form of the name in a directory listing:

        /Namárië.txt
        /Namárië.txt
        /Namárië.txt
        /Namárië.txt

Note that the representations of these names are all different.

FSFS would not require newly created paths to be normalised, nor would
it normalise them when thy are stored; it would only forbid collisions
of identical names.

Option in fsfs.conf:

        [path-representation]
        prevent-name-collisions = true|false

        Default value: true

Note: turning on this option would have some performance impact since
all paths would have to be normalised for lookups.


Option: Require normalised paths
================================

If this option is enabled, FSFS will reject operations that would
create paths in the filesystem that are not in NFC. For example, the
attempt to create a file called

        /Namárië.txt

would fail, because the name is in NFD; but creating a file named

        /Namárië.txt

would succeed.

Option in fsfs.conf:

        [path-representation]
        require-normalized-paths = true|false

        Default value: false

Note that this option cannot be enabled by default, since it might
prevent users from modifying existing files.
