The purpose of this branch is to experiment with speeding up 'svn diff',
especially for large files with lots of unchanged lines.

As a secondary objective, this should also speed up 'svn blame', since blame 
performs a diff on the client side for every revision part of the blame 
operation. This will only be noticeable if the server and network are fast
enough, so the client becomes the bottleneck (e.g. on a LAN, server having a
fast backend (e.g. FSFS on SSD)).

General approach: reduce the problem set for the LCS algorithm as much as
possible, by eliminating identical prefix and suffix before putting the
tokens (lines) into the token tree (see [1] for some background).

Specific approach for this branch: scan for identical prefix/suffix
line-per-line, in the token handling layer (subversion/libsvn_diff/token.c).
This is done by getting tokens (lines) from all files together, skipping
identical prefix/suffix lines, and only then starting to insert the tokens 
into the token tree. This allows the prefix/suffix scanning to take advantage
of normalization (ignore-whitespace and ignore-eol-style options). Also, it
may allow additional optimizations which are difficult to do when scanning
byte-per-byte.

TODO:
  * eliminate identical prefix                         [DONE]
  * eliminate identical suffix                         []
  * make diff3 and diff4 use prefix/suffix scanning    []
  
Other wild ideas (may or may not be worth pursuing):
  * Make prefix scanning able to skip 1 or a couple of non-matching lines, if
    it is able to find strictly more matching lines after that, to keep the
    prefix scanning going.
  * Take advantage of the fact that matching lines often come in batches: when
    inserting a new line into the token tree, and the previous line had a
    match, first try to match the new token with the successor of the
    previously matched line, before binary-searching the tree for a match.
