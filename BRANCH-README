This branch is work in progress towards implementing in repo authz.  In repo
authz allows authz configuration files to be stored directly in the repository.

The design for this code is here:
http://wiki.apache.org/subversion/InRepoAuthz

TODO

* svnserve - I have partial support written, but need to deal with the whole
    --config-file issue.
* tests - Need to finish writing the tests for svn_repos_authz_read2().
    It's not really feasable to handle DAV testing with the way our test
    suite is currently written.  We have two authz directives and 4 different
    styles of authz paths.  So we'd need 8 different Location's to be setup,
    which seems absurd to me.  One alternative is to migrate to always using
    something akin to davautocheck.
* errors - DAV error messages kinda suck since it guesses what it thinks is
    the best error message at current.  When it should display the whole chain.
* refactor svn_repos_authz_read* functions to share a common implementation. 
* documentation - as in the user level docs.

TESTS

Following tests should be developed (+ means we should look for success,
- means we should look for failure).

+ absolute path on OS file system.
+ relative path on OS file system.
+ file:// url to repo path.
+ relative path in repo (^/)
- http:// url
- svn:// url
- OS path that does not exist
- repo path that does not exist
