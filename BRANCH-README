This branch is for work on two closely related issues:

  Issue #3668 'inheritance can result in self-referential mergeinfo'
  
  Issue #3669 'inheritance can result in mergeinfo describing nonexistent
               sources'.

Primarily this branch is about issue #3669.  That's where the difficult
problems are, but fixing issue #3668 without fixing issue #3669 would
result in undesirable behavior, see
http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=3668#desc5
