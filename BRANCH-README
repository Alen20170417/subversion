This branch (wc-collate-path) will contain experiments on the topic of
normalization-agnostic working copies (a.k.a. the Mac HFS Nonsense Problem).

It is not, as such, meant to be ever completely merged to trunk.

Eventually some changes may be merged, others rejected, and still others
migrated to the real feature branch that will have to account for server
behaviour as well as client.
