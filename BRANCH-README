This branch is for development towards getting the python bindings working under
Python 3. [0]

Branch type: dev branch off trunk.

The upstream Python project has previously announced End of Life for Python 2,
with no updates passed some point in 2020. So the bindings need to be updated to
support Python 3. In order to not have to maintain different code for the
difference versions, the py3c [1] was chosen to provide standard compatibility
features for the C extension interfaces for each version.

TODO
----

* Ensure Windows builds still work in light of the addition of the py3c library.
* Make the error more meaningful if the user attempts to build python swig
  bindings, even if py3c was disabled or not found. Currently the error on
  makefile builds is "none: command not found", which isn't very descriptive.
