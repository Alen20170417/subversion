This branch is for the development of changes related to Subversion
issue #2028[1], namely the redefinition of "uri" from an API
perspective to include onto absolute URLs.  The desired outcome is
that Subversion will speak consistently in terms of absolute base
paths (absolute URLs in the RA layers, absolute dirents in the WC
layer, etc.) and paths relative to those.

Because the use of the path APIs in Subversion is so ubiquitous, this
branch will be kept in sync with the 'trunk' -- handling conflicts
here as they occur -- with an eye on eventual reintegration.

This branch is *NOT* guaranteed to build.  In fact, compilation errors
are being intentionally used as cheap pointers to code that needs to
be examined in light of the desired functionality.

Here are the svn_uri_* functions which need to be reviewed/modified:

   svn_url_is_absolute [DONE]

      Remove.  All URLs will be absolute by definition.

   svn_url_join [DONE]

      Replace with svn_url_join_relpath().
   
   svn_url_dirname [DONE]
   svn_url_get_longest_ancestor [DONE]
   svn_url_is_ancestor [DONE]
   svn_url_skip_ancestor [DONE]
   svn_url_condense_targets [DONE]

      Remove code that accepts non-URL URIs (asserting that input is
      valid).

   svn_url_split
   svn_url_basename
   svn_url_is_child

      Remove code that accepts non-URL URIs (asserting that input is
      valid).  URI-decode the returned relpaths .

   svn_url_is_canonical

      Remove code that accepts non-URL URIs (asserting that input is
      valid).  Also, lose unused 'pool' parameter.
   
   svn_url_canonicalize [DONE]

      Assert that we have something vaguely URL-ish to even work with.
   
   svn_url_get_dirent_from_file_url [DONE]
   svn_url_get_file_url_from_dirent [DONE]

      Expect nothing will change here.
   
   svn_url_is_root [DONE]

      This says it's not to be used with URLs, but why not?  Make it
      handle URLs.
