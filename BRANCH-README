This branch exists to add --keep-going to 'svnadmin verify'.
The goal of this flag is to continue the repository verification process even
after detecting a failure/corruption.

USAGE:
------
svnadmin verify --keep-going /path/to/repo

TODO:
-----
1. Add a few more test cases.


2. Show a summary of corruptions by default. So the svnadmin verify
   --keep-going would look something like,

<MOCK>

$ svnadmin verify --keep-going myrepo
* Verifying repository metadata ...
* Verified revision 0.
* Verified revision 1.
* Verified revision 2.
.
.
.
* Error verifying revision 11.
svnadmin: E160013: File not found: revision 11, path '/Trunk'
* Verified revision 12.
* Verified revision 13.
.
.
.
* Error verifying revision 112.
svnadmin: E160004: Invalid change kind in rev file
* Verified revision 113.

Summary of corruptions
----------------------
Total corruptions: 2
rev11: svnadmin: E160013: File not found: revision 1, path '/Trunk'
rev112: svnadmin: E160004: Invalid change kind in rev file
svnadmin: E165005: Repository '/tmp/myrepo' failed to verify

</MOCK>


3. If --keep-going is used along with --quiet option, show only the corruption
   summary so that it would look like,

<MOCK>

$ svnadmin verify --keep-going --quiet myrepo

Summary of corruptions
----------------------
Total corruptions: 2
rev11: svnadmin: E160013: File not found: revision 1, path '/Trunk'
rev112: svnadmin: E160004: Invalid change kind in rev file
svnadmin: E165005: Repository '/tmp/myrepo' failed to verify

</MOCK>
