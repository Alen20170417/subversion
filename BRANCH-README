This branch will be used to implement an alternative solution for
the problem described in issue #4299 in order to solve issue #4556.

Instead of 'svn youngest', we'll implement an extension to 'svn info',
as described in option 1. of issue #4556, as follows:

  - Add a --detail=FIELD option to 'svn info' that will cause it to
    display only the value of FIELD and nothing else; for example:

        $ svn info ^/subversion/trunk --detail=revision
        1660035
        $ svn info ^/subversion/trunk --detail=last-changed-rev
        1660014

    and so on.

  - The --detail option is incompatible with the --xml option

  - Initially, only a few field values will be supported with
    --detail; revision, last-changed-rev, url, relative-url,
      repository-root; maybe a few more.

  - The 'svn youngest' command will be removed.
