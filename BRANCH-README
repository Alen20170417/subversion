This branch is for minor build system improvements.

Changes on this branch:

 ** Split standards-compliance mode and maintainer mode compiler flags
    out of CFLAGS, so that compilation command lines that do not
    generate (too many) warnings or are not forced to comply with ISO
    C '90 can be constructed without having to resort to stripping
    individual flags out of CFLAGS.

    $ svn diff -r1424288:1424822 \
      ^/subversion/branches/tweak-build-take-two/configure.ac \
      ^/subversion/branches/tweak-build-take-two/aclocal.m4 \
      ^/subversion/branches/tweak-build-take-two/build/ac-macros/compiler.m4 \
      ^/subversion/branches/tweak-build-take-two/Makefile.in

 ** Now that warning and standards-compliance mode macros are no
    longer part of CFLAGS, stop stripping them in the Swig wrapper
    configury, except for Ruby, which is more delicate.

    $ svn diff -r1424329:1425040 \
      ^/subversion/branches/tweak-build-take-two/build/ac-macros/swig.m4

 ** Allow optimization and debugging to coexist, including in
    maintainer mode, adding a new configure option
    --enable-optimize. Neither --enable-optimize nor --enable-debug
    will override any optimization or debugging flags set by the user
    in C(XX)FLAGS at configure time. If debugging and optimization are
    enabled at the same time, we will try to use -O1, then -O; if
    debuggin is not enabled, we will try -O2 first.

    $ svn diff -c1424860 \
      ^/subversion/branches/tweak-build-take-two/configure.ac

 ** Remove an obsolete autoconf macro that was not used anywhere and
    is superceded with SVN_CFLAGS_ADD_IFELSE.

    $ svn diff -c1424297 \
      ^/subversion/branches/tweak-build-take-two/build/ac-macros/svn-macros.m4

 ** Move the sqlite-amalgamation directory from the root of the source tree
    under subversion/include/private to make include paths safer from
    possible collision with sqlite include files from other install locations.
