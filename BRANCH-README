svn_fs_t combines node ID, branch ID and noderev ID.  FSX however,
only needs the noderev ID to address noderevs.  So, incrementally
push the usage of svn_fs_t up towards the interface layer.

Once that is done, split the ID storage such that a noderev's ID
field only contains the noderev ID and the other two ID are stored
in a separate field.  This is data model normalization.

Finally, update FSX's svn_fs_t implementation to fetch node and
branch ID on demand instead of storing them in the struct itself.
The resulting svn_fs_t should be only half the size of FSFS'. 

This is a (hopefully) shor-tlived development branch that shall
allow for small, incremental and potentially disruptive changes
instead of few massive patches.
