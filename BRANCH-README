This is an experimental BDB obliterate based on the deltify code. It
replaces a file's rep with an empty delta to the previous rep, thus
effectively making the file contents equal to the previous version
of the file.

This is a partial implementation of the cc1 model in notes/obliterate,
restricted to file text obliteration.  It could probably be extended
to file and directory properties, but anything that changes the tree
structure or anything that needs new node-rev-ids is not going to
work.
