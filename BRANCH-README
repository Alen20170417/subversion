This branch exists to track the implementation of a solution for issue
#3348 ("Provide syntax which means 'include all files *not* in a
changelist'").  It has the following details:

   - Items returned when filtering in this fashion are limited to
     those which support changelists at all -- that is, non-directories.

   - The command-line client UI for performing such filtering is to
     use the --changelist (--cl) option with an empty-string value:

        svn info --cl=""

Both of the above details have been called into question in dev@
discussions, so this branch is NOT ready for reintegration.
