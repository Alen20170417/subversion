This branch is for development of Shelving [0,1].

Branch type: dev branch off trunk; updated by full merges from trunk.

The following branching hierarching shows the intended propogation of changes,
although the actual copy history of the branches is not as shown here.

    trunk          ------------------------    .  catch-up
                       \                       |   merges
    branches/shelve     +------------------    V   .   .
                            \ \                    |   |
    branches/checkpoint      \ +-----------        V   |
                              \                        |
    branches/checkpoint3       +-----------            V

Both of the Checkpointing branches therefore include Shelving functionality.

This branch is now at the point of being ready for user testing, and should
be up to Subversion coding standards, in preparation for merging to trunk.
