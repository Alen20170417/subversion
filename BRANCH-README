Remote-Only Status API
======================

Subversion's "svn status --update" command compares working copy
status with the latest state of the repository. Long-running clients,
such as TortoiseSVN or SmartSVN, which cache working copy state, would
benefit from a version of the svn_client_status API that compares
repository status to the WC BASE tree, ignoring any local
modifications. Whilst these clients could drive the svn_ra_do_status
API directly (and do, at least in the case of SmartSVN 8.5 and later);
however, they do not get enough information from status and/or info to
be able to properly account for nodes omitted from sparse working
copies, which may result in lots of extraneous data being sent from
the server.

This branch is an ongoing research into implementing a variant of the
svn_client_status API that drives the status editor using informatino
only about the BASE tree in wc.db, and does not touch the file system.
