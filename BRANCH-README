This branch exists for the resolution of issue #3975 'adds with
explicit mergeinfo don't get mergeinfo describing merge which
added them'.  The fix for this issue will require several parts
and I don't want to drop a code bomb on trunk with all of them.
Plus I'm not entirely sure there *is* a fix for this issue, so
I'm working in Branchville for now.
