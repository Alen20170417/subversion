This branch is for development towards a solution for Subversion issue
#2779[1] ("subversion does not support redirects").  It is being
maintained as a reintegrateable branch, with occasional syncs from
^/subversion/trunk.

The solution's approach is as follows:

  1. Teach the RA DAV providers to recognize 301 and 302 responses to
     the initial OPTIONS request they always perform as part of
     session opening and capabilities exchange.

      - ra_neon [DONE]
      - ra_serf [see issue #3685]

  2. Rev svn_ra_open3(), teaching the new version to gracefully return
     the suggested URL provided by the server, while still allowing
     old versions to error out on redirections/relocations as they do
     today.  [DONE]

  3. Teach the client 'checkout', 'update', and 'switch' commands to
     recognize these relocation responses and (optionally?) retry the
     operation after performing relocation of the working copy (if
     necessary).

Questions:

  - Should only permanent relocations (301 Moved Permanently) be
    handled specially?

  - Do we want run-time configuration for auto-relocation?
