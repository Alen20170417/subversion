This branch teaches the FS layer to optionally run 'verify' just before commit.

It contains two implementations:

1 - in libsvn_fs:svn_fs_commit_txn().
    TODO: move this one to hook scripts, by exposing a 'svnlook verify -t' UI.
    TODO: alternatively, consider moving fs.conf knobs to be caller-provided,
          so a file open() happens per-worker rather than per-connection
          (in httpd).

2 - in libsvn_fs_fs:commit_body().

TODO: pick which implementation to merge to trunk.  If both remain, the
backend-agnostic one should be made to be a no-op when a the FSAP backend
has a specific implementation (like FSFS now has).
