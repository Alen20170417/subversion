Enabling Normalized Path Lookup in FSFS
=======================================

The purpose of this [fsfs-ucsnorm] branch is to implement
normalization-insensitive path lookups in FSFS. This will prevent the
creation of paths that differ only in normalization, and will also
remove the current constraint that paths used in the FS API must be
byte-for-byte identical to those stored in the filesystem.

The filesystem will *not* impose a particular normalization form, and
it *will* preserve whatever representation it receives when a new path
is created.

This option would be enabled by default for all new FSFS-based
repositories and *disabled* during repository format upgrade. The
option can be disabled or enabled at any time during the lifetime of
the repository; however, it is not safe to enable it without first
running:

        svnadmin verify REPOS --check-ucs-normalization


Proposed argument to 'svnadmin create':

        svnadmin create REPOS --disable-normalized-lookup

Proposed argument to 'svnadmin upgrade':

        svnadmin upgrade REPOS --enable-normalized-lookup

Proposed option in fsfs.conf:

        [normalization]
        enable-normalized-lookup = true|false

        Default value: true
