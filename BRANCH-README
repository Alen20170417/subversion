This branch exists to add --keep-going to 'svnadmin verify'.
The goal of this flag is to continue the repository verification process even
after detecting a failure/corruption.

USAGE:
------
svnadmin verify --keep-going /path/to/repo

TODO:
-----
  - Continue after verification failure and return the correct exit code.
  - Add a few more test cases.
