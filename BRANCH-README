* support for logical addressing
* switch to format 7; use log addressing after for new shards created
  after svnadmin upgrade
* block read / data prefetch for f7 rev / pack file data
* reorder data upon pack
* add checksums to index data
* improve verification to cover all f7 rev / pack file data
