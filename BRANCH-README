This is a feature branch for teaching 'svn patch' to parse
    old mode 100644
    new mode 100755
lines generated by 'git diff'.

Steps:

- [DONE] Implement parse-diff.c support
- [DONE] Implement "make it executable" support, with tests
- [DONE] Implement "make it non-executable" support, with tests
- [TODO] Write tests for adding/remove svn:executable using the normal
         'svn diff' property add/removal syntax
- [TODO] parser: Review handling of modes other than 0644/0755
                 Consider checking "mode & 0111"

- [TODO] Support symlinks as well (mode 120000)
         - add the 'svn:special' property0
         - map the link target representation svn to/from git
  [supporting symlinks is orthogonal to supporting mode changes]

- [TODO] Teach 'svn diff --git' to emit the new form?
         (possibly in addition to the stadard propchange form used for all
         user properties, for compatibility with released 'svn patch' versions)
         Consider the case of an unversioned file being one side of the diff.
