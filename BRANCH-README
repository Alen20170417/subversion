This branch is for development of Checkpointing [0,1].

Specifically, this branch is for Checkpointing backed by a series of patches
stored within the WC, referred to as design "option 1" in [1].

Branch type: dev branch off 'shelve' branch; updated by full merges from
there; not intended to be merged to trunk.

The following branching hierarching shows the intended propogation of changes,
although the actual copy history of the branches is not as shown here.

    trunk          ------------------------    .  catch-up
                       \                       |   merges
    branches/shelve     +------------------    V   .   .
                            \ \                    |   |
    branches/checkpoint      \ +-----------        V   |
                              \                        |
    branches/checkpoint3       +-----------            V

Both of the Checkpointing branches therefore include Shelving functionality.

This branch is now at the point of being ready for user testing, and should
be up to Subversion coding standards, in preparation for merging to trunk.
