This branch is work in progress towards implementing in repo authz.  In repo
authz allows authz configuration files to be stored directly in the repository.

The design for this code is here:
http://wiki.apache.org/subversion/InRepoAuthz

TODO

* svnserve - I have partial support written, but need to deal with the whole
    --config-file issue.
* errors - DAV error messages kinda suck since it guesses what it thinks is
    the best error message at current.  When it should display the whole chain.
* documentation - as in the user level docs.
