This branch will be used to implement an alternative solution for
the problem described in issue #4299 in order to solve issue #4556.

Instead of 'svn youngest', we'll implement an extension to 'svn info',
as described in option 1. of issue #4556, as follows:

  - The 'svn youngest' command will be removed.

  - Add a --show-item=FIELD option to 'svn info' that will cause it to
    display only the value of FIELD and nothing else; for example:

        $ svn info ^/subversion/trunk --show-item=revision
        1660035
        $ svn info ^/subversion/trunk --show-item=last-changed-rev
        1660014

    and so on.

    When the 'svn info' command is invoked on multiple targets or
    in recursive mode, the output will be modified to print the
    requested item and the path or URL of the target:

        $ svn info ^/subversion/trunk -R --show-item=last-changed-rev
        1660014 http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk
        915036 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/BUGS
        ...

  - The --show-item option is incompatible with the --xml option

  - As was the case with the now defunct 'svn youngest' subcommand,
    it's possible to use --no-newline with --show-item.

  - Initially, only a few field values will be supported with
    --show-item; revision, last-changed-rev, url, relative-url,
      repository-root; maybe a few more.


Branch Status
=============

TODO:
  - Add tests for 'svn info --show-item'.
  - Modify --show-item output with multiple targets and/or recursive
    mode to display both the requested item and the (relative) path
    and/or URL it applies to.

DONE:
  - Removed 'svn youngest' (already merged to trunk before 1.9.x branch).
  - Implemented 'svn info --show-item [--no-newline]' with output suitable
    for single targets.
