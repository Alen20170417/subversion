Purpose of this branch:
  Implement dump/load cross-checking in the test suite.

Kind of branch:
  Development branch -- regular catch-ups from trunk

TODO:
  - Fix FAIL: svnmucc_tests.py 2: a no-op content-change is reported
    differently in different cases. (Fix it how? I'd prefer to make the
    output of a no-op change the same as a no-change.)

Ideas for improvement:
  - Improve the logic for finding repositories created by a test: detect
    when a test created a repository even if the sandbox is not marked as
    'built'; detect when a test created additional repositories.

  - Implement the same cross-checking for the C tests.
