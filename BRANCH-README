The purpose of this branch is to see if we can replace the 'send delta to
file before commit' mechanism with a streaming approach.  Streaming would
allow us to avoid writing (possibly huge) temporary files containing svndiff
during operations like svn commit and import happening over http:// protocol.
A quick set of experiments shows that there might be a noticeable overhead
associated with writing these files, apart from the fact that creating them
requires a certain amount of disk space.

The branch should be maintained with catch-up merges from trunk.
