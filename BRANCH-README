This branch exists to attempt an implementation of the FSFS library in pure
Python.  While some probably think that is crazy talk (and rightly so!) a
number of people I've talked to over the past few weeks have been quite
interested.  My main motivation in doing so is that it gives us a starting
point to rapidly prototype new FS implementation ideas.

I don't know that this work will every migrate back to trunk, but I'm putting
it in the repo in the hopes that other interested souls can take a look and
that it may one day be useful to somebody besides myself.  Plus, I like using
version control. :)

The overarching goal is to have a python module which implements a FS object
which could then be used to interact with a FS filesystem directly, or via
some higher-level repository layer.  To facilitate that, as well make
development and testing easier, this is being done by embedding the Python
implementation into a new library, libsvn_fs_py.  This library will have the
same C interface as any other FS-level library, so should be easily testable
using the existing test suite.

The main tasks involve implementing each one of the fs_library_vtable_t and
fs_vtable_t functions as Python methods, along with all the underlying
support machinery.  We'll see how far it gets.
