This branch is develop a revised revprop caching logic as discussed in
http://svn.haxx.se/dev/archive-2014-08/0273.shtml.

Implementation is now complete.  This is what got implemented:

* Bind revprop caching feature to format bump.  This prevents 1.8 processes
  from using 1.9+ revprop generation files and vice versa.  Also, 1.8
  revprop generation files get automatically cleaned up during format
  upgrade.

* Always read the revprop generation from the respective file, keep the
  latter open for quasi-SHM speed.
* Non-caching processes will bump the generation number as well to keep
  other, caching ones up-to-date.
* Atomicy of revprop generation changes cannot be guaranteed (reader /
  writer race condition).  Use an MD5 checksum to ensure that consistent
  has been read.
* Open the generation file in read-only mode by default to prevent errors
  on r/o file systems.  This is an improvement over the 1.8 code.

* Close and reopen the generation file when bumping its content for the
  first time after we acquired the FS write lock.  This keeps us from
  reading from stale file buffers (lost updates) in case of networked
  storage.
* Always read the revprop data from disk when atomically changing it.
  This is to prevent lost updates in the revprop data itself.

* Removal of the whole named atomics code.
