TODO:
  - Write a proper BRANCH-README file.
  - Split externals_tests.py:copy_pin_externals into separate test cases.
    Right now it's a monolithic monster that's hard to understand and
    interferes with parallel test execution; so, not suitable for trunk.

DONE:
  - JavaHL test for ISVNClient.copy with explicit list of externals to pin.
