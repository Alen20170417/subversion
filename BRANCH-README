This branch is for the development of changes related to Subversion
issue #2028[1], namely the redefinition of "uri" from an API
perspective to include onto absolute URLs.  The desired outcome is
that Subversion will speak consistently in terms of absolute base
paths (absolute URLs in the RA layers, absolute dirents in the WC
layer, etc.) and paths relative to those.

Because the use of the path APIs in Subversion is so ubiquitous, this
branch will be kept in sync with the 'trunk' -- handling conflicts
here as they occur -- with an eye on eventual reintegration.

This branch is *NOT* guaranteed to build.  In fact, compilation errors
are being intentionally used as cheap pointers to code that needs to
be examined in light of the desired functionality.

Here are the svn_uri_* functions which need to be reviewed/modified:

   svn_uri_is_absolute [DONE]

      Remove.  All URLs will be absolute by definition.

   svn_uri_join

      Remove.  Maybe add svn_uri_join_relpath() (though
      svn_path_url_add_component2() should be sufficient)
   
   svn_uri_split
   svn_uri_basename
   svn_uri_dirname
   svn_uri_is_canonical
   svn_uri_get_longest_ancestor
   svn_uri_is_child
   svn_uri_is_ancestor
   svn_uri_skip_ancestor
   svn_uri_condense_targets

      Remove code that accepts non-URL URIs (asserting that input is
      valid).
   
   svn_uri_canonicalize

      Assert that we have something vaguely URL-ish to even work with.
   
   svn_uri_get_dirent_from_file_url [DONE]
   svn_uri_get_file_url_from_dirent [DONE]

      Expect nothing will change here.
   
   svn_url_is_root

      This says it's not to be used with URLs, so purge this function
      and rework its current usage to use something else.
