This is a development branch, intended to implement RA context abstraction
layer in libsvn_client.

The branch should be maintained with catch-up merges from trunk.

The branch is going to be merged to trunk with detailed log message describing
all changes made in the branch.

STATUS
======
+ Initial implementation
- Do not call svn_ra_* methods in find_session_by_url() because callback
  table may be destroyed at that time.
- Add new RA capability to signal if RA session is stateless and reusable.
- Implement svn_client_close_all_sessions()
- Merge to trunk and start switching code to use new functions.

PROBLEM
=======

Currently Subversion client layer creates new RA session for every
svn_client_* call. Even more: for some operations like svn_client_merge() it
creates 10-15 RA sessions. Each session creation takes significant amount of
time: TCP connection, SSL handshake, authentication and initial handshake. It 
easily could take several seconds over WAN.

PROPOSED SOLUTION
=================

The idea is introduce RA context abstraction layer for managing set of RA
sessions for different repositories and reuse them if possible. In the first
version it going to be implemented in libsvn_client as private layer, but
we can make it part of ra-loader in future.
