This branch exists to add --ignore-mergeinfo to 'diff', 'st' and 'log.
The goal of this flag is to allow the user to filter changes to mergeinfo
from various reporting operations, thus allowing them to more easily detect
"real" changes of interest.  Several modes need to be supported:

 * 'log'
   - Retrieve logs from the server
   (The ignore-mergeinfo-log branch is currently implementing this mode.)

 * 'diff'
   - Local diff
   - URL <-> WC diff
   - URL <-> URL diff
   - Diff summarize (in the above modes)

 * 'status'
   - Local status
