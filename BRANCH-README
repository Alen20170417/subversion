This branch is for prototyping Checkpointing backed by a local repository
embedded within the WC, referred to as design "option 3" in [1].

Branch type: dev branch off 'shelve' branch; updated by full merges from
there; not intended to be merged to trunk.

Initially this is prototyping, to explore the general shape of the design
and user interface. As such, the coding style is hacky and does not comply
with Subversion coding requirements.
