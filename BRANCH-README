This 'tree-read-api' branch is a feature branch to develop a new API.
As a 'feature' branch, it is maintained by periodic 'catch-up' (aka
'sync') merges from trunk, and may one day be reintegrated to trunk.

The new API is an abstraction of a generic tree of (probably) versioned
nodes -- files, directories and symbolic links, each node optionally
having a set of versioned properties.  The idea is that client code that
reads from a tree can use the same interface to read the WC base as it
uses to read revision X in a repository.  Some examples of such client
functionality are 'list', 'proplist', 'propget' and 'export'.

If this works out and can be made efficient, it should enable existing
libsvn_client code to be simplified and new client code to be written
more easily.

At the time of this writing, the API is in subversion/libsvn_client/tree.h,
but I expect to move it.
