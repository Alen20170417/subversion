This branch contains a series of patches which make the dotted leader in the
output of 'make check' a status bar for the progress of the individual python
tests.  It does this by loading the tests as modules, rather than just shelling
out to run them.

Unfortunately, there was some breakage associated with running the tests in 
parallel, and when using different src and build directories (as is common
on Windows).  So I've stashed the patches on this branch, in the hopes that
one day I'll come back and fix 'em.
