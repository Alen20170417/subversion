This is a feature branch for teaching 'svn patch' to parse
    old mode 100644
    new mode 100755
lines generated by 'git diff'.

Steps:

- [DONE] Implement parse-diff.c support
- [DONE] Implement "make it executable" support, with tests
- [TODO] Implement "make it non-executable" support, with tests
- [TODO] Write tests for adding/remove svn:executable using the normal
         'svn diff' property add/removal syntax
- [TODO] parser: Review handling of modes other than 0644/0755
                 Consider checking "mode & 0111"

Optional:

- [TODO] Should 'svn diff --git' be taught to emit the new form?
         (possibly in addition to the stadard propchange form used for all
         user properties, for compatibility with released 'svn patch' versions)
