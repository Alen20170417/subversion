This branch (^/subversion/branches/authzperf) will be used to build a better
search engine. Er ... that is, reimplement svn_authz_t & co. so that it
allows much faster authz resolving and avoids the many full authz file scans.

TODO:

* implement an authz-specific constructor for the config parser
* implement precedence rules
* implement value-expansion mode in the config parser

DONE:

* O(1) check that a rule applies to a given user
* construct a prefix tree from the path rules
* pre-calculate rule sets for the given user
* implement recursive tree checks
* implement evaluation shortcuts
* parametrize in-memory representation constructor in the config parser
* add support for full-segment wildcards ("/*/")
* add support for variable length full-segment wildcards ("/**/")
* add support for prefix segment patterns ("/foo*/")
* add support for suffix segment patterns ("/*foo/")
* add support for arbitrary patterns ("/foo*bar*baz/" etc.)
