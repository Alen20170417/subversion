This branch teaches the FS layer to optionally run 'verify' just before commit.

It contains two implementations:

1 - in libsvn_fs:svn_fs_commit_txn().
    TODO: alternatively, consider moving fs.conf knobs to be caller-provided,
          so a file open() happens per-worker rather than per-connection
          (in httpd).
    This one will be retired.  'svnadmin verify -t' has been implemented and
    can be called from pre-commit to implement this approach.

2 - in libsvn_fs_fs:commit_body().
    TODO: make this not-always-on

TODO: pick which implementation to merge to trunk.  If both remain, the
backend-agnostic one should be made to be a no-op when a the FSAP backend
has a specific implementation (like FSFS now has).
