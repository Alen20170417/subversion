The purpose of this branch is to see if we can replace the 'send delta to
file before commit' mechanism with a streaming approach.  Streaming would
allow us to avoid writing (possibly huge) temporary files containing svndiff
during operations like svn commit and import happening over http:// protocol.
A quick set of experiments shows that there might be a noticeable overhead
associated with writing these files, apart from the fact that creating them
requires a certain amount of disk space.

The branch should be maintained with catch-up merges from trunk.

The branch should NOT be merged back to trunk.

STATUS
======

Quick implementation showed that there is no visible overhead associated with
the temporary files.  In my environment, the streaming approach behaves almost
exactly the same, but implementing it adds a *lot of complexity*.  Perhaps
doing so could spare us a few seconds when committing large files -- e.g.,
.iso -- but overall, the complexity is not worth the benefit.

A couple of observations that happened while developing this branch resulted
in the r1704317 change [1] (Use compressed svndiff1 format for deltas when
committing changes over http:// and https://) committed to trunk.

There are no plans on continuing this branch.  It's left in its current state,
in case it could get useful in the future.
