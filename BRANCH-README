This branch exists for the resolution of issue #3390.  It's intent is
to be managed as a reintegrate-able branch, with regular catch-up
merges from the trunk.

Having said that, the state of svn:externals processing on the trunk
has apparently diverged vastly since this branch was cut, and some are
advising that the branch be trashed and re-cut from a newer trunk.
