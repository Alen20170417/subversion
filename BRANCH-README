The contents of svn:mergeinfo has a significant impact on the performance
of merges and may also require large amounts of storage.  A client-side
tool shall remove redundant or obsolete mergeinfo and will reduce the
number of individual ranges in the remainder.

Features implemented:

* analyze
  Creates a report listing paths where mergeinfo can be removed entirely
  and what makes it impossible to remove the mergeinfo from other nodes.
  The user may then explicitly merge those sub-tree specific changes
  and retry afterwards.

* normalize --remove-redundant
  Removes all mergeinfo from a node, if *all* of it is either
  - redundant with the parent contents
    (same ranges for the respective branches)
  - inoperative outside the respective sub-tree
    (revisions marked as merged in the sub-node but not the parent
     don't modify paths within the sub-node and outside in the same
     revision)
  - revisions listed for the parent only are inoperative on the sub-tree
    (revisions marked as merged at the parent but not the sub-node did
     not modify the sub-tree)
  "parent" means the next higher node in the working copy that also
  has mergeinfo on it.

* normalize --remove-obsolete
  Remove mergeinfo for branches that no longer exist repo@HEAD.

* normalize --combine-ranges
  Combine adjacent revision ranges if any separating revisions are
  inoperative on the respective sub-tree.

* remove-branches
  Remove mergeinfo referring to the given branches from the working copy.

TODO:

* Proper docstrings
* Verify that results are actually equivalent to original state
