This branch will receive a number of patches that boost
svn:// single-threaded throughput from about 5Gb/s to
10Gb/s for typical source code, i.e. becomes capable of
saturating a 10Gb connection.

Http:// will speep up by almost the same absolute value,
1 second being saved per GB of data.  Due to slow processing
in other places, this gain will be hard to measure, though.

Bottlenecks to address:

* frequent cancellation / abortion checks on the server
  side (intense OS interaction)
* in-memory copies (membuffer cache -> empty deltification
  -> output buffer -> network stack)
* various CPU-heavy tasks

The patches have been written quite some time ago and I
want them off my disk.  OTOH, release 1.8 shall not be
endangered.  After testing and stabilization of this branch,
parts of it may be merged into /trunk before 1.8.
