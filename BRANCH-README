This 'showing-merge-info' branch is a feature branch to experiment with
improvements to the user interface to merging.  As a 'feature' branch, it
is maintained by periodic 'catch-up' (aka 'sync') merges from trunk, but
it is not currently expected to be reintegrated to trunk as a whole.

### Many commits on this branch are intentionally experimental, unfinished,
### undocumented, and in other ways not of the quality expected on trunk.

- Julian Foad, October 2011
