FSFS locking doesn't scale well as lock and unlock operate on single
paths and every operation has to rewrite all the digests and the digest
of '/' refers to every lock in the repository.  A long-term solution
probably involves a repository upgrade to a new storage scheme but a
short-term fix is to operate on multiple paths and reduce the number
of times the digest files are written.

Create new APIs that operate on multiple paths:

  svn_fs_lock2
  svn_fs_unlock2
  svn_repos_fs_lock2
  svn_repos_fs_unlock2

For ra_local connect svn_ra__vtable_t.lock and unlock to the repos
functions.

For svnserver connect "lock-many" and "unlock-many" to the repos
functions.
