The contents of svn:mergeinfo has a significant impact on the performance
of merges and may also require large amounts of storage.  A client-side
tool shall remove redundant or obsolete mergeinfo and will reduce the
number of individual ranges in the remainder.

Features implemented:

* analyze
  Creates a report listing paths where mergeinfo can be removed entirely
  and what makes it impossible to remove the mergeinfo from other nodes.
  The user may then explicitly merge those sub-tree specific changes
  and retry afterwards.

* clear-obsoletes
  Removes all mergeinfo for branches that don't exist in HEAD.

* normalize
  Removes all mergeinfo from a node, if *all* of it is either
  - redundant with the parent contents
    (same ranges for the respective branches)
  - inoperative outside the respective sub-tree
    (revisions marked as merged in the sub-node but not the parent
     don't modify paths within the sub-node and outside in the same
     revision)
  - revisions listed for the parent only are inoperative on the sub-tree
    (revisions marked as merged at the parent but not the sub-node did
     not modify the sub-tree)
  "parent" means the next higher node in the working copy that also
  has mergeinfo on it.

* combine-ranges
  Combines neighboring ranges if they are compatible (same "inheritable"
  flag) and the revisions in between are inoperative on the respective
  path.

TODO:

* Proper documentation (docstrings etc.)
* Progress output
* Remove redundant code
* Decide upon sub-command set / granularity
* Verify that results are actually equivalent to original state
