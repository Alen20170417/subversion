What should be finished before merging the ra_serf-auth branch back to trunk:

1. A new version of serf needs to be released, including this patches (or other
   solutions for the respective issues):
- Add new request at the beginning of the queue: avoids sending requests 
  out-of-order:
  http://groups.google.com/group/serf-dev/t/9361be2713c70e98
- Add the 'cansend' callback to avoid a storm of failed requests
  http://groups.google.com/group/serf-dev/t/77964e0c8de69f6
- Handle situation where response_handlers cancels a request (not specific to 
  ra_serf-auth):
  http://groups.google.com/group/serf-dev/t/231fd26aef519248

2. Check the list of remaining test failures to see if they're related to 
   running the tests with a different username or not:
FAIL:  prop_tests.py 12: set, get, and delete a revprop change
FAIL:  merge_tests.py 57: skipped paths get overriding mergeinfo
FAIL:  trans_tests.py 1: commit new files with keywords active from birth
FAIL:  blame_tests.py 4: blame output in XML format
FAIL:  lock_tests.py 7: examine the fields of a lockfile for correctness
FAIL:  lock_tests.py 21: examine the fields of a lock from a URL
FAIL:  lock_tests.py 33: verify recursive info shows lock info
FAIL:  lock_tests.py 34: unlock file locked by other user
FAIL:  authz_tests.py 1: authz issue #2486 - open root
FAIL:  authz_tests.py 4: test authz for read operations
FAIL:  authz_tests.py 10: test authz for aliases
FAIL:  authz_tests.py 12: test authz for locking

3. Test NTLM auth with different configurations on Win2K3 server.
   (see also http://subversion.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2807)

4. Check if ra_serf NTLM works the same as neon NTLM
   - fallback to basic
   - guest account
   - https

5. Add documentation where needed

Other features I hoped to have finished:
6. Proxy support
   Can be added after the merge to trunk, probably won't have time to finish 
   this before 1.5 anyway.

7. Kerberos support 
  (Kerberos can be implemented using SSPI too)
   Can be added after the merge to trunk, probably won't have time to finish 
   this before 1.5 anyway.
