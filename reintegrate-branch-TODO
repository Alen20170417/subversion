Task list for the "reintegrate" branch.

Merge-back-to-trunk blockers
============================

* Correct the "is there any real mergeinfo?" check.

* Propagate the new include_decendents boolean to the DAV RA layers.

* Port FSFS mergeinfo index changes to BDB backend.

* Add black box tests for 'merge --reintegrate'.

* Deal with renamed merge target, when the mergeinfo is up-to-date, but
  under an unexpected name


Remaining work (which can be done post-merge)
=============================================

* Fix UI constraints for 'merge --reintegrate', which is "incompatible"
  with --ignore-ancestry and --record-only

* Add C test for svn_mergeinfo_intersect().

* Examine "TODO(reint)", including (but not limited to):

  * Error messages

  * "Is this the same line?" direct ancestor check

  * authz check
